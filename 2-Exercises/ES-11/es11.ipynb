    "An agricultural watershed was urbanized over a 20 year interval. A triangular one-hour unit hydrograph was developed for this watershed for an excess rainfall duration of one hour.\n",
    "Before urbanization, the average infiltration rate and other losses was 0.30 in/hr.\n",
    "Figure 1 is the unit hydrograph had a peak discharge of 400 cfs/in occurring at 3 hours, and a base time of 9 hours.\n",

    "After urbanization the loss rate was reduced to 0.15 in/hr and the peak discharge of the unit hydrograph was increased to 600 cfs/in occurring at 1 hour, and the base time was reduced to 6 hours. Figure 2 is the unit hydrograph with a peak discharge of 600 cfs occurring at 1 hours, and a time base of 6 hours.\n",
