    "## Solution(s)\n",
    "1. **Flow Duration Curve** is a cumulative frequency curve that shows the percent of time specified discharges were equaled or exceeded during a given period. It combines in one curve the flow characteristics of a stream throughout the range of discharge, without regard to the sequence of occurrence. [https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/wsp1542A](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/wsp1542A)<br>\n",
    "2. **Flood Frequency Curve** is used to relate flood discharge values to return periods to provide an estimate of the intensity of a flood event. The discharges are plotted against return periods using either a linear or a logarithmic scale. In order to provide an estimate of return period for a given discharge or vice versa, the observed data is fitted with a theoretical distribution using a cumulative density function (CDF).

    "3. **Stormwater Best Management Practices** are devices, practices, or methods that are used to manage stormwater runoff by controlling peak runoff rate, improving water quality, and managing runoff volume. [https://spcwater.org/topics/stormwater-management/stormwater-best-management-practices-2/](https://spcwater.org/topics/stormwater-management/stormwater-best-management-practices-2/)<br>\n",
    "4. **What is a Catchment?**  A catchment is an area where water is collected by the natural landscape. [https://www.waternsw.com.au/water-quality/education/learn/catchment](https://www.waternsw.com.au/water-quality/education/learn/catchment)<br>\n",
    "5. **What is a watershed?**  Itâ€™s a land area that channels rainfall and snowmelt to creeks, streams, and rivers, and eventually to outflow points such as reservoirs, bays, and the ocean.
