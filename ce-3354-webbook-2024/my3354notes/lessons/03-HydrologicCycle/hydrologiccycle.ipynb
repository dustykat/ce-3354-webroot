    "# Surface and Groundwater Hydrology Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is hydrology?\n",
    "- Study of the occurrence, circulation, storage, and distribution of surface and groundwater on the Earth.\n",
    "- Engineering hydrology is the quantification of amounts of water at various locations (spatially) as a function of time (temporally) for surface water applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a watershed (catchment)?\n",
    "Here are a couple of definitions of watersheds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Topographic area that collects and discharges surface streamflow through one outlet or mouth (pour point)\n",
    "- The area on the surface of the Earth that drains to a specific location\n",
    "- In groundwater a similar concept is called a groundwater basin – only the boundaries can move depending on relative rates of recharge and discharge \n",
    "\n",
    "The topographic definition omits that there could be subsurface sewer systems that can cross topographic boundaries.   It’s a big deal in urban areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a hydrologic system?\n",
    "A hydrologic system is just a collection of parts that interact.   \n",
    " \n",
    "- A hydrologic system is simply the collection of connected components that form the <strong>hydrologic cycle</strong>\n",
    "- These components can be grouped into subsystems, treated separately, and the results combined according to interactions between the subsystems (CMM pg 5) \n",
    "\n",
    "Like in fluid mechanics, the system has boundaries (the control volume) and fluxes into/out of the boundaries.   \n",
    "The entire planet is usually considered a closed system (hydrologically) and only the energy fluxes cross the boundary.   \n",
    "At more practical scales (parking lot) the mass fluxes matter a lot.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ### What is the hydrologic cycle?\n",
    "Here is a typical diagram depicting the hydrologic cycle.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](hydrologic_cycle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The driving force for the cycle (not shown) is solar energy that provides the energy to vaporize liquid water that then rises into clouds, moves onshore, and rains (or snow, sleet, $\\dots$.  and other forms of <strong>precipitation</strong>)\n",
    "A portion of the rain becomes runoff, another portion returns to the atmosphere as evaporation, another portion infiltrates into the ground and becomes groundwater.\n",
    "\n",
    "The surface water system would be the part of the diagram that lies above the plane defined by the ocean and infiltration line.\n",
    "The subsurface system is the part that is below this plane.\n",

    "## Hydrologic Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "The water, or hydrologic, cycle describes the journey of water as water molecules make their way from the Earth’s surface to the atmosphere and back again, in some cases to below the surface. This gigantic system, powered by energy from the Sun, is a continuous exchange of moisture between the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land.\n",
    "A typical diagram depicting the hydrologic cycle is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](hydrologic_cycle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The driving force for the cycle is solar energy that provides the energy to vaporize liquid water that then rises into clouds, moves onshore, and rains (or snow, sleet, $\\dots$.  and other forms of <strong>precipitation</strong>)\n",
    "A portion of the rain becomes runoff, another portion returns to the atmosphere as evaporation, another portion infiltrates into the ground and becomes groundwater.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more detailed accounting of the precipitation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A portion known as interception is retained on buildings, vegetation, and other surfaces that eventually evaporates - the remaining quantity is called **effective precipitation**\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Excess precipitation is a similar concept.  When discussing rainfall-runoff processes using some model (i.e. unit hydrograph methods), the quantity that becomes runoff is called excess precipitation.  The terms are frequently used interchangeably.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Some of the effective precipitation also evaporates directly.\n",
    "3. Another portion of effective precipitation **infiltrates** into the ground - a portion of infiltrated water returns to the atmosphere via transpiration, the remainder either percolates deeper into the ground or is incorporated in the vegetative biomass.\n",
    "4. The water that percolates deeper into the ground becomes **recharge** to the groundwater system, and may appear at some point as **baseflow** in streams.\n",
    "5. If the precipitation exceeds the combined evaporation and infiltration puddles form in small depressions on the land surface - this is called depression storage.\n",
    "6. After the depressions are filled they join and a continuous film of water can begin to flow over the surface to a stream channel.  This portion that can flow is called the **excess precipitation** (see the note above), and the flow is called the **direct runoff**.\n",
    "7. Runoff occurs when the film of water begins to move - water in this film is said to be in **detention storage**, and evaporation occurs from this compartment too. When precipitation ceases, the water in detention storage eventually joins the stream channel.\n",
    "8. The destination of all streams is open bodies of water such as lakes, seas, and oceans which are subject to substantial evaporation.\n",
    "9. The evaporation and tanspiration from all these sources combine and carry moisture back into the atmosphere which condenses and repeats the cycle.\n"
