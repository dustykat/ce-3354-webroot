# # Unit Hydrographs (In Class Exercise)

# ## Exercise 1
# 
# Determine the direct runoff hydrograph resulting from the rainfall pattern in Figure P2-2(a) using the triangular 1-hr UH given in  Fig. P2-2(b)
# 
# ![](Raro001.png)

# Workflow:
#     
# 1. UH is for 1-hr **excess precipitation**.
# 2. Is the hyetograph in 1-hr increments?  
#   - Yes, proceede
#   - No, convert supplied hyetograph into equivalent 1-hr increments (or whatever is dictated by the UH)
# 3. Has the loss function been applied?
#   - Yes, proceede
#   - No, apply loss function to each hyetograph increment
# 4. On suitable chart plot each increments response onto the chart - remember to lag the responses consistent with the increment timing.

# Consider the watershed below.  Area A and B are identical in size, shape, slope, and channel length. 1-hr UH are supplied fro natural and developed conditions for both areas.
#

# 
# Determine:
# 1. Assuming natural conditions for both areas determine the outflow at point 1 if 2.5 in.hr of rain falls for 2 hrs.  Total loss is 1 in.
# 2. Assume area B is fully developed, area A remains au naturel.  Determine the outflow at point 1 if 2.0 in/hr of **excess rain** falls for 1 hrs.  
# 3. Repeat the above for both areas fully developed.
