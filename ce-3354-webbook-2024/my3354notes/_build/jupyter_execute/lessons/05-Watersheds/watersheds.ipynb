    "\n",
    "A watershed is the area of land that drains all the streams and rainfall to a common outlet such as the outflow of a reservoir, mouth of a bay, or any point along a stream channel (this outlet is called a pour-point in GIS-speak). The term “watershed” is often used interchangeably with “drainage basin,” which may make the concept easier to visualize. \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "A common outlet implies that the various discharges have concentrated into a a definable conduit (as opposed to sheet or overland distributed flow).  The distributed flows are part of the watershed, but at times make engineering analysis at smaller scales challenging as no single control point exists.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "A watershed can encompass a small area of land that drains into a trickling creek. It can encompass multiple states in the Midwest, all draining into the Mississippi River. Or it can encompass multiple countries draining into the Atlantic Ocean. No matter where you are standing or sitting right now, you are in a watershed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Water is constantly in motion, be it via ocean currents, precipitation, or slowly moving through underground aquifers. Any given watershed is part of the larger whole of our global water supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smaller watersheds can make up larger watersheds. The Mississippi River has many tributaries (each of which has its own watershed), and in turn empties into the Gulf of Mexico, which connects to the Atlantic Ocean. The U.S. Geological Survey delineates our nation’s watersheds as “Hydrologic Units,” which are assigned hydrologic unit codes. These can range in scale  from expansive water resource regions covering millions of square miles down to tiny local tributary systems. There are 90,000 hydrologic unit codes  designated nationwide.

    "\n",
    "Watershed delineation is a fundamental process in hydrology and environmental science that involves defining the boundaries of a drainage area or catchment. It identifies the geographic area from which all precipitation and surface runoff flow into a single outlet, typically a river, stream, or lake.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. By-hand and/or semi-automated using digital maps (obsolete, but viable for small areas)\n",
