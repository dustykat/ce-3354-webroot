    "## Some Commonly Used Speciality Software\n",
    "\n",
    "In the field of hydrology and hydraulics analysis, several software tools are widely used to simulate, model, and analyze various aspects of water flow, drainage systems, and hydraulic structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Surface Water Hydrology \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most prevalent software packages is HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engineering Center - Hydrologic Modeling System), developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. HEC-HMS is a powerful tool for modeling rainfall-runoff processes, watershed response, and streamflow routing. It allows engineers to simulate different hydrological conditions, assess flood risks, and design effective flood control measures. With its comprehensive features for data input, model calibration, and result visualization, HEC-HMS is a staple in hydrological modeling studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The European Union equivalent to HEC-HMS is MIKE SHE; a comprehensive hydrological modeling software developed by DHI, a global consulting and software company specializing in water and environmental solutions. MIKE SHE is widely used in Europe and globally for simulating hydrological processes, including rainfall-runoff, soil moisture dynamics, groundwater flow, and surface water interactions. Similar to HEC-HMS, MIKE SHE allows engineers and hydrologists to model watersheds, assess flood risks, and design water management strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For urban drainage and stormwater management, the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is also widely used. SWMM is a dynamic simulation model that simulates rainfall-runoff processes, sewer system hydraulics, and pollutant transport in urban areas. It allows engineers to design and optimize stormwater management systems, including storm sewers, detention basins, and green infrastructure practices. With its flexible modeling framework and comprehensive range of features, SWMM is an essential tool for sustainable urban water management and flood risk mitigation.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "SWMM is an integrated hydrology/hydraulic model whereas HEC-HMS is strictly a hydrology model (with some limited hydraulics)\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Surface Water Hydraulics\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used software in hydraulic engineering design is HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center - River Analysis System), also developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. HEC-RAS is specifically designed for modeling river hydraulics, open channel flow, and floodplain inundation. It enables engineers to evaluate river morphology, analyze bridge and culvert hydraulics, and assess floodplain encroachment. With its robust computational capabilities and intuitive graphical interface, HEC-RAS is indispensable for designing bridges, levees, and other hydraulic structures in riverine environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As already mentioned, SWMM is a hydraulic model with hydrologic components; It is another tool suitable for river hydraulics, open channel flow, culvert hydraulics, and inundation studies.  SWMM is intended for use at a smaller geographical scale than HEC-RAS, but the limitation is largely conceptual.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "SWMM is an integrated hydrology/hydraulic model whereas HEC-RAS is strictly a hydraulic model.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Management Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these specialized software packages, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software such as ArcGIS and QGIS are commonly used in conjunction with hydrological and hydraulic modeling tools. GIS enables engineers to integrate spatial data, perform spatial analysis, and visualize modeling results in a geographic context. By combining GIS with hydrological and hydraulic software, engineers gain insight into the spatial distribution of water resources, watershed characteristics, and flood hazards, facilitating informed decision-making in engineering design projects."

    "### Why QGIS instead of ESRI products? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have already used the University-ble\\$\\$ed ESRI GIS products in GIST 3300/5300 Geographic Information Systems, or other [GIS-based courses at TTU](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/geosciences/geog/research/gist.php), and wonder why I choose QGIS.  The two main reasons are:\n",
    "1. QGIS is Open Source (free to download and install).\n",
    "2. It will run in some form without much fuss on a PC, MAC (both intel, and Apple silicon), and in Linux (on intel/amd and arm silicon). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have ESRI-based GIS tools use them, no good reason to install a second GIS.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} Several other factors may influence someone to choose QGIS over other similar GIS (Geographic Information System) tools. Here are some reasons why individuals and organizations might prefer QGIS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open Source and Free: QGIS is open-source software, meaning it is free to use and distribute. This can be a significant advantage for users or organizations with budget constraints, as it provides powerful GIS capabilities without the need for a substantial financial investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Active Community Support: QGIS has a vibrant and active user community. This community contributes to the development of the software, creates plugins, and provides support through forums and documentation. The availability of community support can be valuable for users seeking assistance or looking to extend QGIS's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cross-Platform Compatibility: QGIS is designed to run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This cross-platform compatibility makes it accessible to users with different operating system preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- User-Friendly Interface: QGIS is known for its user-friendly interface, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced GIS professionals. The software employs an intuitive layout and design, facilitating ease of use for those new to GIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extensive Functionality: QGIS offers a broad range of tools and features for data visualization, editing, and analysis. Its functionality is comparable to many proprietary GIS tools, and it continues to evolve with regular updates and new releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plugin System: QGIS has a robust plugin system that allows users to enhance and extend the software's capabilities. Users can install plugins to add specific functionalities tailored to their needs, making QGIS adaptable to a wide range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interoperability: QGIS supports various data formats and standards, ensuring compatibility with data from different sources. This interoperability makes it easier to integrate QGIS into existing workflows and work with diverse geospatial datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customization: Users can customize QGIS to suit their specific requirements. This includes customizing symbology, creating tailored layouts, and utilizing plugins to add specialized tools, making QGIS adaptable to a variety of use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the choice between GIS tools depends on the specific needs, preferences, and constraints of the user or organization. QGIS's open-source nature, community support, and extensive functionality make it a compelling choice for many GIS users.\n",
