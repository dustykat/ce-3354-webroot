# ## Missing Data Replacement Techniques
# 
# In the estimation of missing data from a raingauge station, performance of a group of
# neighbouring stations including the one with missing data are considered. A comparison
# of the recordings of these stations are made by using their normal rainfall as standard
# of comparison. The normal rainfall is the average value of rainfall at a particular date,
# month or year over a specified 30-year period. The 30-year normal is recomputed every
# decade. Thus, the term normal annual precipitation at a station A means the average annual precipitation at station A based on a specified 30-year of record. Insertion of
# missing data to a station record must be done sparingly. If too many data are estimated,
# the quality of the total data set may be diluted due to interpolation. sometimes, if too
# many gaps exist in a record, it may be worthwhile to neglect that station than to have
# a station record with too much of interpolated data. A WMO guideline states that not
# more than 5 to 10% of a record should have interpolated data.
# 
# 
# **Missing Data Estimation Procedure**<br>
# *Problem Statement*<br>
# Given the annual precipitation values $P_1, P_2, P_3,\dots ,P_m$ at neighbouring $M$ stations $1, 2, 3, \dots, M$ respectively, estimate the missing annual precipitation $P_x$ at station $X$ not included in the above $M$ stations. The normal annual precipitations $N_1, N_2,\dots,N_i, \dots$ at each of the above ($M+1$) stations, including station $X$, are known.
# 
# *Procedure*<br>
# - If the normal annual precipitations at various stations are within about 10\% of the normal annual precipitation at station X then the station-average method (arithmetic mean) is sufficient to estimate $P_x$. Thus,
# $P_x = \frac{1}{M}(P_1 + P_2 + \dots + P_M)$
# - If the normal annual precipitations vary considerably then $P_x$ is estimated by weighing the precipitation at various stations by the ratios of normal annual precipitations. This method, known as the normal ratio method, gives $P_x$ as
# $P_x = \frac{N_x}{M}(\frac{P_1}{N_1} + \frac{P_2}{N_2} + \dots + \frac{P_M}{N_M})$

# ## Example
# The **normal** annual rainfall at stations A, B, C and D in a basin are 80.97, 67.59, 76.28 and 92.01 cm respectively. In 1985, the station D was inoperative and the stations A, B and C recorded annual precipitation of 91.11, 72.23 and 79.89 cm respectively. Estimate
# the rainfall at station D in that year
