    "While **Design storms** are created from statistical models of observations, incorporating observed precipitation data offers a faithful representation of actual weather patterns and variability, capturing nuances that statistical design storm models may overlook. By using observed data, engineers can better assess real-world risks, enhancing the reliability and precision of infrastructure designs and flood mitigation strategies. Additionally, observed precipitation data provide valuable insights into localized climatic trends and extreme weather events, enabling proactive adaptation measures to address changing environmental conditions effectively.\n",

    "At times, there might be motivation to study the source observations - so how to obtain data is important.  There are likely multiple sources of data - here we will examine just a few.\n",

    "This is the easiest, and may suffice in many situations.  The National Climatic Data Center maintains historical records of climate related data - in some locations over a century of data exist.  Using our study area, and current online tools one can find gages near the study site. \n",

To draw the polygon, use the tool on the layers panel, then choose polygon and draw the outline.\n",
