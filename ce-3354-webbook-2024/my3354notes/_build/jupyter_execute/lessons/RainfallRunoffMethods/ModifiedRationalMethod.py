# # Modified Rational Method
# 
# ## Background
# The rational method is used to estimate peak discharges for sizing drainage structures, such as storm drains and culverts. The modified rational method (MRM) is an extension of the rational method to produce simple runoff hydrographs. The MRM is often called the rational hydrograph method. Application of the MRM produces a runoff hydrograph and runoff volume in contrast to application of the rational method, which produces only a peak design discharge (Qp). 
# 
# The hydrograph developed from application of the MRM is a special case of the unit hydrograph method and is sometimes termed the modified rational unit hydrograph (MRUH); as a unit hydrograph, the MRUH can be applied to nonuniform rainfall distributions. Furthermore, the MRUH can be used on watersheds with drainage areas in excess of the typical limit for application of the rational method. Application of the MRUH method involves two steps: (1) determination of rainfall loss using rational method concept, that is, use of the runoff coefficient, and (2) determination of the MRUH using drainage area (A) and time of concentration (Tc) as input parameters, in addition to applying the procedure of unit hydrograph convolution.  
# 
# Tc and runoff coefficients, C, can be estimated by a variety of methods.

# ## Modified Rational Method Hydrograph Generator
# 
# This script performs discrete convolution to generate a direct runoff hydrograph from a hyetograph for a drainage area using the modified rational method unit-hydrograph approach (cite).
# 
# The direct runoff hydrograph is computed using a convolution integral:
# 
# $$ Q(t) = \int_{0}^{\tau}{p(t)u(t-\tau)d\tau} $$
# 
# where
# - $p(t)$ is the excess rainfall hyetograph
# - $u(t)$ is the drainage area response kernel (a unit hydrograph)
# - $Q(t)$ is the direct runoff hydrograph
# 
# The response kernel for the modified rational method is
# 
# $$ u(t) = \frac{A}{T_c}~\text{for}~t \le T_c$$
# 
# where
# - $A$ is the contributing drainage area
# - $T_c$ is the time of concentration
# 
# The excess rainfall hyetograph is obtained from the precipitation input signal as
# 
# $$ p(t)=C \times P(t) $$
# 
# where
# - $C$ is the rational equation runoff coefficient
# - $P(t)$ is a rainfall hyetograph (design storm)
# 
# The example script below illustrates the calculations for an NRCS Type 2 design storm, the other design storms are included and a simple change in storm type in the `interp1d(minutes, type2, kind='linear')` function call (i.e. change type2 to another type in the program). Alternatively the analyst could supply any hyetograph they choose, but would have to fuss a bit with the array lengths.
# 
# The script has several prototype functions:
# > `Convolve` is the discrete convolution integrator <br>
# > `kernel` is the $u(t)$ kernel function above <br>
# > `ModRat` is the function that actually computes the time-shifted response kernel, scales inputs and outputs to produce dimensional outputs
# 
# After these prototype functions is a block that generates an input excess rainfall hyetograph. The next block is the input block, the actual function call to `ModRat`, some mass balance summary calculations.
# Finally the plotting section prepares graphical output, reports the inputs, summary values in the chart title, and then charts the input hyetograph (an excess hyetograph, losses are already removed), and the direct runoff hydrograph.
