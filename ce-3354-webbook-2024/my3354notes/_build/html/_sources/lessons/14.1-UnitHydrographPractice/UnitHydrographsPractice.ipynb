    "2. Is the hyetograph in 1-hr increments?  \n",
    "  - Yes, proceed to step 3\n",
    "  - No, convert supplied hyetograph into equivalent 1-hr increments (or whatever is dictated by the UH), return to beginning step 2\n",

    "  - Yes, proceed to step 4\n",
    "  - No, apply loss function to each hyetograph increment, return to beginning step 3\n",
    "4. On suitable chart (or in a spreadsheet, or in a script) plot each increment's response onto the chart - remember to lag the responses consistent with the increment timing.\n",
