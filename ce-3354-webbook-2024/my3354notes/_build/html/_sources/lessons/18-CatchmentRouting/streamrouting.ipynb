    "## What is Level Pool Routing applied to a stream reach?\n",
    "\n",
    "Level Pool Routing applied to a stream reach is a hydrologic technique used to estimate how a flood wave or flow pulse travels through a reach of a stream, treating the reach as if it behaves like a reservoir or a level pool. In this method, the storage in the stream reach is assumed to be a function of the water surface elevation, which is relatively constant across the reach at any given time, akin to the behavior of a reservoir.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique is based on the principle of mass conservation, described by the continuity equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta S = I - O$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta S$ is the change in storage, <br>\n",
    "$I$ is the inflow, and<br>\n",
    "$O$ is the outflow.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Level Pool Routing, the **storage-outflow** relationship is crucial, as it relates the storage in the reach to the outflow, often using a known empirical or analytical function derived from observations or topographic data. The method solves for the change in storage and computes the outflow from the reach at each time step, typically using iterative methods or graphical solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Assumptions in Level Pool Routing for a Stream Reach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uniform Water Surface Elevation: The water surface elevation across the stream reach is assumed to remain level, meaning that storage is dependent only on the depth of water in the reach, not the slope.\n",
    "- Quasi-Steady Flow Conditions: This method assumes **steady flow** within **each time** increment (...a sequence of steady states), focusing on the cumulative inflow and outflow over time.\n",
    "- Simplified Geometry: The stream reach is treated as having simplified geometry, often approximating a reservoir-like behavior, even though the reach may have some slope and varying channel shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Application in Hydrologic Modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flood Routing: Level pool routing is commonly used for flood routing when water storage effects dominate (such as wide floodplains or slow-moving rivers).\n",
    "- Dam Breach Modeling: It is also frequently applied in scenarios where the stream behaves similarly to a reservoir, such as when simulating the routing of a dam breach flood wave through a downstream reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though Level Pool Routing is an approximation, it provides a simple and effective way to model stream reaches where the water movement is slow, and storage is a key factor in determining flow characteristics downstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method is also known by the names Puls Routing, Modified Puls Routing, and/or Storage-Indication Method. It is typically used for rivers or streams with significant storage effects (e.g., where floodplains or reservoirs influence flow). This method is common in hydrologic models that simulate unsteady flow, such as during flood events, providing estimates of stream discharge at various points downstream."

    "A method that includes consideration of wedge storage is Muskingum routing (Named after the [Muskingum River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskingum_River) in Ohio.\n",

    "The method is appropriate for a stream reach that has approximately constant geometric properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "At the upstream end, the inflow and storage are assumed to be related to depth by power-law models\n",
    "\n",
    "$I= a y_u^n$ <br>\n",
    "$S_I = b y_u^m$ <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "At the downstream end, the outflow and storage are also assumed to be related to depth by power-law models\n",
    "\n",
    "$O= a y_d^n$ <br>\n",
    "$S_O = b y_d^m$ <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The depths at each end are rewritten in terms of the power law constants and the inflows\n",
    "\n",
    "$S_I=\\frac{bI^{m/n}}{a^{m/n}}$ <br>\n",
    "$S_O=\\frac{bO^{m/n}}{a^{m/n}}$ <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then one conjectures that the storage within the reach is some weighted combination of the section storage at each end (weighted average)\n",
    "\n",
    "$S = wS_I + (1-w)S_O$<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The weight, $w$, ranges between 0 and 0.5.\n",
    "- When w = 0, the storage in the reach is entirely explained at the outlet end (like a level pool)\n",
    "- When w = 0.5, the storage is an arithmetic mean of the section storage at each end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally the variables from the power law models are substituted\n",
    "\n",
    "$K=\\frac{b}{a^{m/n}}$, and <br>\n",
    "$z = m/n$<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "And the routing model is expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$S=K[wI^z + (1-w)O^z$\n",
    "\n",
    "if $z$ is assumed to be unity the expression results in the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$S=K[wI + (1-w)O]$\n",
    "\n",
    "For most natural channels $w$ ranges between 0.1 and 0.3 and are usually determined by calibration studies\n",
    "\n",
    "Muskingum-Cunge further refines the model to  relate the values of the weights to channel geometry, slope, and resistance features.  At this level of abstraction (Muskingum-Cunge) the model is nearly a hydraulic model.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Muskingum-Cunge routing and the kinematic wave method are nearly identical because both techniques focus on approximating how flood waves propagate through a stream or channel, with a primary emphasis on downstream flow movement rather than complex backwater effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flow Assumption: Both methods are based on the assumption that the dominant flow process is advective transport, meaning the flow is driven primarily by the slope of the channel and the velocity of the water, with minimal consideration for upstream effects or changes in flow depth (e.g., backwater effects). This is why both methods work well for gradually varied flows in channels with relatively mild slopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linearization of Equations: Both Muskingum-Cunge and kinematic wave methods simplify the Saint-Venant equations (full dynamic wave equations). The kinematic wave neglects the inertia and pressure terms, reducing the complexity of the momentum equation to focus on gravity-driven flow. Similarly, Muskingum-Cunge introduces a finite difference approach to linearize and stabilize the continuity and momentum equations, which approximates flow movement without the need for solving the full dynamic equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numerical Similarities: The Muskingum-Cunge method uses a numerical scheme that results in flow propagation behavior closely resembling the kinematic wave model when applied to simple flow scenarios (such as uniform or steady-state conditions). The key difference is that Muskingum-Cunge includes a diffusive term, providing a slight smoothing of the flow, but under many conditions, this effect is minimal, making the two methods yield almost identical results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, both methods are used for streamflow routing in gradually varied flows where downstream propagation of flood waves dominates, and flow variations over time are smooth and predictable. The slight difference lies in Muskingum-Cunge's ability to account for limited diffusion, but this is often negligible in practical applications, making the two approaches nearly interchangeable.\n",
