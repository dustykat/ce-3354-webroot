<h1>Precipitation over an Area<a class="headerlink" href="#precipitation-over-an-area" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The measurement techniques described here have all concentrated on measuring rainfall at a precise location (or at least over an extremely small area).  In reality, the hydrologist needs to know how much
precipitation has fallen over a far larger area, usually
a catchment. To move from point measurements to
a spatially distributed estimation it is necessary to
employ some form of spatial averaging. The spatial
averaging must attempt to account for an uneven
spread of rain gauges in the catchment and the various factors that we know influence rainfall distribution
(e.g. altitude, aspect and slope). A simple arithmetic
mean will only work where a catchment is sampled
by uniformly spaced rain gauges and where there is
no diversity in topography. If these conditions were
ever truly met then it is unlikely that there would be
more than one rain gauge sampling the area. Hence
it is very rare to use a simple averaging technique.
There are different statistical techniques that
address the spatial distribution issues, and with the
growth in use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) it is often a relatively trivial matter to
do the calculation. As with any computational task
it is important to have a good knowledge of how
the technique works so that any shortcomings are
fully understood. Three techniques are described
here: Thiessen’s polygons, the hypsometric
method and the isohyetal method. These methods are explored further in a Case Study on p. 40.</p>
<div class="section" id="thiessens-polygons">
<h2>Thiessen’s polygons<a class="headerlink" href="#thiessens-polygons" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Thiessen was an American engineer working around
the start of the twentieth century who devised a
simple method of overcoming an uneven distribution of rain gauges within a catchment (very much
the norm). Essentially Thiessen’s polygons (Thiessen
1911) attach a representative area to each rain gauge.
The size of the representative area (a polygon) is based
on how close each gauge is to the others surrounding
it, but all points within a polygon are closer to its rain
gauge than any of the other rain gauges.
Polygons are drawn by connecting the nearest rain
gauges to each other by lightly drawn lines. The perpendicular bisector of each connecting line is then
found, and these are extended to where they intersect
with other perpendicular bisectors. The boundaries
of the polygons are therefore equidistant from each
gauge (see Figure 2.13). Once the polygons have
been drawn, the area of each polygon surrounding a
rain gauge is found. The spatially averaged rainfall
(R) is calculated using Form</p>
<p>HHHHHHHHHHHHH</p>
<p>he polygon surrounding rain gauge i, and A is the
total catchment area (ai
/A is therefore the proportion of the catchment occupied by each polygon,
and the set of these for a catchment are known as
Thiessen coefficients).
The areal rainfall value using Thiessen’s polygons is a weighted mean, with the weighting being
based upon the size of each representative area
(polygon). This technique is only truly valid where
the topography is uniform within each polygon so
that it can be safely assumed that the rainfall distribution is uniform within the polygon. This would
suggest that it can only work where the rain gauges are located initially with this technique in mind</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hypsometric-method">
<h2>Hypsometric method<a class="headerlink" href="#hypsometric-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since it is well known that rainfall is positively
influenced by altitude (i.e. the higher the altitude
the greater the rainfall) it is reasonable to assume
that knowledge of the catchment elevation can be
brought to bear on the spatially distributed rainfall estimation problem. The simplest indicator
of the catchment elevation is the hypsometric (or
hypsographic) curve. This is a graph showing the
proportion of a catchment above or below a certain
elevation. The values for the curve can be derived
from maps using a planimeter or using a digital
elevation model (DEM) in a GIS.
The hypsometric method of calculating spatially
distributed rainfall then calculates a weighted
average based on the proportion of the catchment
between two elevations and the measured rainfall
between those elevations (Equation 2.2).</p>
<p>(2.2)
where rj
is the average rainfall between two contour intervals, ai
is the area between those contours
(derived from the hypsometric curve), and A is the
total catchment area. So ai
/A is again the proportion
of the catchment, but this time on the basis of the
area between the contours rather than each polygon,
as was the case in the previous method. The rj
value
may be an average of several rain gauges where there
is more than one at a certain contour interval. This
is illustrated in Figure 2.14 where the shaded area
(a3) has two gauges within it. In this case the rj
value
will be an average of r4 and r5.
Intuitively this is producing representative areas
for one or more gauges based on contours and spacing, rather than just on the latter as for Thiessen’s
polygons. There is an inherent assumption that
elevation is the only topographic parameter affecting rainfall distribution (i.e. slope and aspect are ignored). It also assumes that the relationship
between altitude and rainfall is linear, which is not
always the case and warrants exploration before
using this technique</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="isohyetal-method">
<h2>Isohyetal method<a class="headerlink" href="#isohyetal-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Where there are a large number of gauges within
a catchment the most obvious weighting to apply
on a mean is based on measured rainfall distribution
rather than on surrogate measures as described above.
In this case a map of the catchment rainfall distribution can be drawn by interpolating between the
rainfall values, creating a smoothed rainfall surface.
The traditional isohyetal method involved drawing
isohyets (lines of equal rainfall) on the map and calculating the area between each isohyet. The spatial
average could then be calculated by Equation 2.3:
R r a
A i
n
j i = 








 =
∑1
(2.3</p>
<p>where ai
is the area between each isohyet and ri
is the
average rainfall between the isohyets. This technique
is analogous to Figure 2.14, except in this case the
contours will be of rainfall rather than elevation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="areal-reduction-factors">
<h2>Areal Reduction Factors<a class="headerlink" href="#areal-reduction-factors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Areal reduction factors (ARFs) are used in precipitation modeling to account for the spatial variability of rainfall across a region. Precipitation is not uniformly distributed over an area, and ARFs help adjust point rainfall measurements to better represent the average precipitation for a larger region.</p>
<p>In precipitation modeling, meteorologists often collect rainfall data from specific points, such as weather stations. However, this point data may not accurately reflect the variability of precipitation over a broader area. ARFs are applied to these point measurements to estimate the average precipitation over a larger spatial scale.</p>
<p>The factors influencing areal reduction include topography, land use, and other geographical features that affect how rainfall is distributed across an area. By applying ARFs, modelers can better capture the spatial patterns of precipitation, improving the accuracy of rainfall estimates for hydrological and environmental studies. This consideration is crucial for various applications, such as flood risk assessment, water resource management, and climate modeling.</p>

<h2>Radar Precipitation Estimation<a class="headerlink" href="#radar-precipitation-estimation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Radar rainfall estimates involve using weather radar systems to measure precipitation over a given area. These estimates are valuable for various applications, including weather forecasting, hydrological modeling, and flood management. Unlike point measurements from rain gauges, radar provides spatially continuous information about precipitation distribution.</p>
<p>Radar systems emit radio waves that interact with precipitation particles in the atmosphere. By analyzing the returned signals, meteorologists can estimate the intensity and location of rainfall across a region. However, radar data may still contain uncertainties and errors that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>To improve the accuracy of radar rainfall estimates, meteorologists often employ various correction techniques. One common method is gauge adjustment, where radar data are calibrated using ground-based rain gauge measurements. Another approach involves applying quality control measures to filter out artifacts and errors in the radar signal.</p>
<p>Additionally, radar-based estimates may be adjusted using gauge-to-radar ratios to better represent ground-level precipitation. These ratios help account for potential biases in the radar measurements, ensuring that the radar-derived rainfall values align more closely with <strong>ground truth</strong> observations.</p>
<p>Radar rainfall estimates provide valuable information about precipitation patterns over a wide area, but correction and adjustment methods are required to maintain accuracy and reliability for applications in meteorology and hydrology.</p>
