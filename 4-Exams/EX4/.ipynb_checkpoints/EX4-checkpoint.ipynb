During a long drought the flow in the creek **decreases** by 1.1 cubic meters per second between two gaging stations along the creek located 6 kilometers apart. On the west side of the creek the hydraulic head contours run parallel to the bank of the creek and the contour levels decrease as one moves **away** from the creek at a rate of 0.0007 m/m. The head contours on the east side of the creek are also parallel to the creek and the levels decrease as one moves **towards** the creek at a rate of 0.0003 m/m.\n",
