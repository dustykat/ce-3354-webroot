%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% From ES1-P4 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item The equation $k\frac{dQ}{dt} + Q(t) = I(t)$ is used to describe the response of streamflow to a constant rate of precipitation applied indefinitely on some watershed.  

Suppose that $Q(t)=0$ for $t=0$, the watershed characteristic time constant is $k=2~hrs$, and $I(t) =2$ for $t=[0,12)~hrs$ and then $I(t) =0$ for $t=[12,24]~hrs$. 

Determine:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The necessary equation(s) to predict the response $Q(t)$ over the 24-hour period.
\item Plot the values of $Q(t)$ over the 24-hour period (see next page for empty plot).

\item  Figure \ref{fig:topoMap.jpg} is a  topographic map of a small drainage basin.  The drawn contour interval is 20 feet.  Many of the contours are labeled.   A culvert structure is located on the Eastern portion of the basin, near the outlet shown on Figure \ref{fig:topoMap.jpg}.   The red line is a highway alignment, beneath which the culvert structure is placed.  Figure \ref{fig:Pan1.JPG} is a photograph of the culvert system that is comprised of 4-parallel , 4-foot diameter, 100-foot long culverts.  The lowest portion of the road near the culverts is at elevation 595 feet.  The culverts are laid on a dimensionless slope of $0.02$.
