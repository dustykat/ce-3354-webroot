## Watershed Definition(s)

Recall our definitions:

- Topographic area that collects and discharges surface streamflow through one outlet or mouth (pour point)
- The area on the surface of the Earth that drains to a specific location
- In groundwater a similar concept is called a groundwater basin – only the boundaries can move depending on relative rates of recharge and discharge 

The topographic definition omits that there could be subsurface sewer systems that can cross topographic boundaries.   
It’s a big deal in urban areas.

## Water Budget Definition
The water budget, or <strong>hydrologic balance</strong> is simply the expression of the conservation of mass in hydrologic terms for a hydrologic system.  
Generally it is expressed as a rate (or volume) balance.
The hydrologic equation is the fundamental tool in hydrology to describe amounts of water in storage in different compartments at different scales.  

The equation expressed in “words” is

Rate of inflow - Rate of outflow =  Rate of change of storage + Rate of internal mass generation.

Symbolically it is exrepssed as:

$$ \frac{dI}{dt} - \frac{dO}{dt} = \frac{dS}{dt} + \frac{dG}{dt}$$

where

$I$ is inflow volume, $O$ is outflow volume, $S$ is storage volume (i.e. within a watershed), and $G$ is generated volume.
$G$ is generally zero, but is included to be consistent with the balance equations you have learned elsewhere (i.e. environmental engineering, chemistry, $\dots$)

## Water Budget Example
Consider the following problem statement:

One way to answer the questions is to decompose the problem into a simpler construct, usually by sketching a diagram as shown below:

Now we can simply assign the terms to the appropriate parts of the water balance equation and solve for unknown components.
