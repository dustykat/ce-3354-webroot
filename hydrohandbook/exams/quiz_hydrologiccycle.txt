C. Infiltration
D. Evaporation
Answer: B

2. What term describes precipitation that runs off into streams after all other storage and loss processes are accounted for?
A. Groundwater
B. Depression storage
C. Excess precipitation
D. Effective precipitation
Answer: C

3. What term refers to water held temporarily on surfaces like leaves before evaporating?
A. Recharge
B. Detention storage
C. Interception
D. Direct runoff
Answer: C

4. The part of precipitation that infiltrates and becomes part of the aquifer is called:
A. Baseflow
B. Recharge
C. Detention storage
D. Interception
Answer: B

5. What happens to water in detention storage after rainfall ends?
A. It evaporates completely
B. It infiltrates back into aquifers
C. It contributes to streamflow

7. In the water balance equation, which term is often negligible and set to zero?
A. Inflow
B. Outflow
C. Storage
D. Internal mass generation
Answer: D

8. In the combined hydrologic system, which is true?
A. Groundwater and surface water do not interact
