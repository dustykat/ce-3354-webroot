    "\n",
    "<!-- When further questioned (by modifying the input prompt somewhat, and adjusting the \"temperature\" parameter in the prediction engine) six broad categories of essential skills a Civil Engineer needs to practice engineering hydrology are identified as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Hydrological Analysis and Modeling**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Knowledge:Hydrological analysis and modeling are at the core of engineering hydrology. This involves understanding and simulating the water cycle, including rainfall, snowmelt, river flows, and groundwater movement. Hydrologists use complex mathematical models to predict how water moves through the environment. These models help in designing effective flood control systems, predicting droughts, and managing water supplies. By accurately simulating hydrological processes, engineers can plan for various scenarios and develop solutions that mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events.\n",
    "- Skills : Proficiency in using hydrological models (e.g. HEC-HMS,SWMM) to simulate water flow,precipitation, and runoff.\n",
    "- Ability : The ability to interpret model outouts regarding the movement, distribution, and quality of water within the Earth's atmosphere and surface to make informed decisions regarding water availability, managing water resources, and designing hydraulic structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Data Collection and Analysis**\n",
    "- Knowledge: In engineering hydrology, data is paramount. Hydrologists collect data from a variety of sources, such as weather stations that measure rainfall, stream gauges that monitor river levels, and remote sensing satellites that provide imagery of large areas. Once collected, this data needs to be meticulously analyzed to identify trends, understand patterns, and validate models. High-quality data analysis ensures that predictions and designs are based on reliable information, which is critical for making informed decisions about water management and infrastructure development.\n",
    "- Skills: Proficiency in gathering and analyzing data from various sources, such as weather stations, stream gauges, and remote sensing technologies.\n",
    "- Ability: The ability to manage and analyze large datasets including precipitation, streamflow, and soil moisture data in order to generate reliable inputs for understanding hydrological processes, validating models, and making informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Understanding of Hydrological Processes**\n",
    "- Knowledge: A deep understanding of hydrological processes is essential for any hydrologist. This includes knowledge of how water interacts with the environment through processes like precipitation, evapotranspiration (the combination of evaporation and plant transpiration), infiltration into the soil, surface runoff, and groundwater flow. By understanding these processes, hydrologists can predict how changes in climate, land use, and vegetation will affect water availability and quality. This knowledge is crucial for developing strategies to manage water resources sustainably and protect against water-related hazards. Knowledge of fluid mechanics and hydraulic principles to design and evaluate water conveyance systems such as channels, culverts, and stormwater management systems. Knowledge of environmental regulations and guidelines related to water resources.\n",
    "- Skills:  Proficiency with tools such as HEC-RAS and SWMM for river and streamflow analysis.  Deep knowledge of processes like precipitation, evapotranspiration, infiltration, runoff, and groundwater flow.\n",
    "- Ability: Apply the knowledge to make informed predictions and and decisions under different environmental conditions. Conduct impact assesssments to evaluate the effects of projects on hydrological bejavior and aquatic ecosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing**\n",
    "- Knowledge: GIS and remote sensing technologies are powerful tools in the field of hydrology. GIS allows hydrologists to create detailed maps and spatial analyses that show how water moves across different landscapes. Remote sensing, on the other hand, provides data from satellites and aircraft that can monitor large and inaccessible areas. Together, these tools enable the study of watershed characteristics, land use impacts, and temporal changes in water bodies. They are essential for tasks such as flood mapping, drought assessment, and habitat conservation.\n",
    "- Skills: Using GIS and remote sensing tools to analyze spatial and temporal patterns in hydrology; delineate watersheds; construct digital elevation models (DEM) of watersheds; determine land cover type to inform hydrologic models.\n",
    "- <font color = 'red'>Ability: Apply the technology for mapping watersheds, analyzing land use impacts, and monitoring changes in water bodies.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Computer Programming and Software Proficiency**\n",
    "- Knowledge: Modern hydrology relies heavily on computer programming and specialized software. Hydrologists use programming languages like Python, MATLAB, and R to develop custom models, automate data analysis, and perform complex simulations. Proficiency with hydrological software such as HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Modeling System), SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), MODFLOW (a groundwater flow model), and SWMM (Storm Water Management Model) and the EU and Asian equivalents is also essential. These tools allow for detailed analysis of hydrological systems and enable the integration of various data sources into cohesive models, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of hydrological studies.\n",
    "- Skills: Programming skills and software proficiency to facilitate efficient data analysis, model customization, and automation of repetitive tasks.\n",
    "- Ability: Ability to use programming languages (like Python or MATLAB) and hydrological software (such as HEC-HMS, SWAT, or MODFLOW).  Use of tools to refactor data files to meet project and model needs, and prepare presentation exhibits for reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Project Management and Communication**\n",
    "- Knowledge: Hydrological projects require strong project management skills. This includes planning, organizing, and overseeing projects to ensure they are completed on time and within budget. Hydrologists must coordinate with other engineers, scientists, policymakers, and the community to achieve project goals. Effective communication is crucial, as hydrologists must present complex technical information in a clear and understandable manner to stakeholders. This ensures that the implications of their findings are understood and can inform decision-making processes, ultimately leading to better water management practices.\n",
    "- Skills: Competence in managing projects, including planning, budgeting, and coordinating with stakeholders, as well as effectively communicating findings.  Completion of assigned tasks in a timely fashion. \n",
    "- Ability: Apply project management principles so that hydrological studies and projects are completed on time and within budget.  Employ clear communication methods (presentations, reports, graphical exhibits) so that results are understood and used appropriately by decision-makers and the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "These 6 essential topics equip hydrologists to tackle the complex challenges of managing water resources in a sustainable and efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course has a substantial emphasis on selected topics in categories 1-4; categories 5 and 6 are largely experience based; category 5 is also a moving target.   -->"

    "## Importance of Hydrology in Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrology is the study of water(s) of the earth.  Environmental and Civil Engineers need an understanding of the hydrological cycle concept and the ability to answer engineering questions about hydrologic circumstances.  Such broad questions include: \n",
    "- Where does water come from?\n",
    "- What are surface and groundwater compartments? \n",
    "- How does water cycle through the system?\n",
    "- How much time does water spend in a compartment?\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition they need to be able to determine the quality (purity) of the water in anticipation of its use, to determine the assimilative capacity of a compartment, and to determine the amount of water available for both supply and drainage purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrologic quantification concepts are important in:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Water Supply:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- How much is available?\n",
    "- Where is it located? Surface or subsurface (AKA Groundwater)\n",
    "- What is the quality of the water?\n",
    "- What processes will be needed to purify the water to a desired level?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Waste disposal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where will the water be discharged? Surface or subsurface\n",
    "- What is the discharge quality?\n",
    "- Can the receiving compartment assimilate the waste materials?\n",
    "- What is needed to purify the waste to a desired level so it can be discharged?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drainage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Low flows: Habitat preservation. Waste water discharge capacity. Water supply.\n",
    "- “Routine” flows. Flows associated with precipitation and other forces that are relatively common in frequency and magnitude; these are flows we expect to live with. Effect on infrastructure, esp. transportation, but also manufacturing. Management of pollutants carried from facilities.\n",
    "- “Flood” flows. Flows associated with precipitation and other forces that are uncommon in frequency and/or magnitude; these flows that are expected to interrupt daily activities – engineering goals are to preserve life and protect large-value properties.\n",
    "> Flooding is an environmental hazard – floodwaters are usually polluted and may present a significant source of disease.\n",
    "> Flooding is lethal – lives are lost, often from plain ignorance but not always.\n",
    "> Civil infrastructure (bridges, highways, airports, water and wastewater treatment plants, dams, hospitals, government buildings, etc.) are supposed to survive flooding and be back in service very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineering hydrology uses sets of “tools” to help answer these kinds of questions (or at least prepare for the extreme events).  \n"

    "## Water Uses\n",
    "Water has multiple uses and each of these uses impacts the water differently. Most of the major uses are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drinking water** is considered the highest beneficial use of water in the USA. Oddly enough, we each only **NEED** about a 5-liters per day (temperate zone) for survival, perhaps 15-liters per day for survival, cooking, and hygiene (not counting toilets) (Alloway, D., 200#). Thus Houston’s 500MGD treatment capacity is enough to support the basic needs of well over 100 million people, but much of our drinking water goes to other uses. This odd situation is based on public health decisions made over a century ago at the dawn of the sanitation theory of disease. Similar situations exist in the rest of the developed world, although Europe and Asia are further along in separate potable and non-potable systems that in the USA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agricultural** use is probably the second highest beneficial use in the USA as it is directly related to the production of food and raw materials. The quality requirement of the water is much different than for human consumption, but generally the mineralogical quality (dissolved monovalent ions) is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industrial water** use ranges from product water (Ozarka is an industrial product, regulated by the FDA), to water in heat exchangers. The quality can be variable depending on the use. For example, water used in semi-conductor manufacture is probably the closest to chemically pure water found outside a laboratory, while water in closed-loop heat exchange would poison tube worms (a creature found in undersea geothermal vents that derive their energy from conversion of reduced sulfur species – i.e. indestructible!).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Power generation** (hydropower and geothermal) uses enormous volumes of water to spin turbines to generate electricity. If you ever get the chance to visit Hoover Dam (Las Vegas) or the Grand Coulee Dam (Washington), you can see classic examples of a pure hydropower (Hoover), and a pump-storage/hydropower (Grand Coulee) system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figures below depict some of the features of the Grand Coulee Dam, which is currently the largest producer of hydropower in the United States, and the third largest in the world. (The other two are in China and Argentina, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Columbia_basin_project.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below is the generator gallery - there are three such galleries; combined they are quite large (easily 1/5 mile across).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](grandcoulee.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below is a drawing of one such generator and ancillary plumbing\n",
    "\n",
    "![](generator.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the drawing, the power tunnel (penstock) is 18 feet in diameter. A tractor-trailer truck could fit in an 18-foot tunnel; and the water velocities in these tunnels are well above 10 feet per second, so the volume passing through the tunnels when producing electricity are huge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below is a drawing of a generator-pump unit, that is part of the pump storage system to the Southwest of the dam.  In this drawing the discharge tunnel (which doubles as a penstock, when the flow is reversed) is 12 feet in diameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](pumpgenerator.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Navigation** also uses and moves large amounts of water. In most cases navigation, power generation, and recreation are mutually compatible. Probably the most famous navigation system is the Panama Canal. Close to home is the inland waterway system operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority that essentially connects Knoxville Tennessee to the ocean (via Ohio River and the Intra-coastal Waterway). A schematic is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](tvasystem.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recreational** use includes both sport fishing, and contact recreation (swimming, etc.). In this use bacteriological quality is important as ingestion of water and aerosols occurs in these uses. The principal public health issue is to prevent water-borne disease. An example of disease related to water quality (and thus hydrology) are occassional outbreaks of [vibrio vulnificus in the coastal waters of Texas](http://54.243.252.9/ce-3354-webroot/hydrohandbook/chapters/01-introduction/vibrio_article.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Waste Assimilation** is an important use that certainly puts as much water back into the hydrosphere as is removed for drinking, agricultural, and industrial uses. Essentially all wastewater either treated or not is returned to the hydrosphere, and this use of the receiving stream greatly impacts its quality, and thus is subsequent use. The purpose of treatment is to return water at a quality that natural systems can treat and/or assimilate. Historically the measure of quality has focused on oxygen content, BOD, TSS, and bacteriological indicators. If the wastewater is sufficiently low in the last three parameters and high enough in the first, then the receiving stream can complete the “cleansing” process. Industrial chemicals complicate the issue as do dissolved metals which are toxic to most species that are part of the natural treatment process. Storm water is considered a form of wastewater and is beginning to receive more and more attention both in its quantity (wasted water resource; destructive force) and quality (degrader of natural systems – an arguable point of view, but regulated nevertheless). (http://www.epa.gov/ebtpages/watewastewater.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Habitat** is the designation of water use for maintaining species considered valuable for economic and/or aesthetic reasons. For example, waterfoul harvesting in the USA has a direct economic impact in the 2- billion dollar a year range, and thus maintenance of viable habitat for ducks and geese is economically important, and these habitats need specific volumes of water a particular times. Unfortunately, past practices has created situations where this water use is in direct competition with other economically valuable uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Water “Problems”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drainage and Flooding\n",
    "\n",
    "Drainage and flooding are relatively obvious problems. Drainage is concerned with removing water from areas to prevent nuisance inundation (i.e. highways) so that commerce can continue. In the early days of aviation, “all-weather” aircraft were a big deal, because commerce could continue regardless of environmental conditions; in a similar vein we have come to expect our daily lives to be only mildly impacted by the weather. \n",
    "\n",
    "Flooding in the usual context is **catastrophic** flooding that causes **MEASURABLE** economic damage, and several hours of loss of service of the public and private infrastructure. Both areas are the domain of civil and environmental engineers as they are expected to be able to predict magnitude and locations, as well as design ways to prevent or reduce damage (an essentially impossible duty, but we can help people make good decisions).\n",
    "In for example Houston, residents experience four types of flooding: hurricane tidal surge, bayou flooding, secondary drainage system flooding (streets and storm sewers), and nuisance flooding (which is my designation of a subset of the last category, main economic loss is mobility).\n",
    "\n",
    "Various engineering strategies that have been proposed or implemented are: coastal levee protection system, with huge pumps to deal with waters that breach the levee (like New Orleans); deep tunnel/underground storage (includes letting the sanitary system operate surcharged); pumped canal systems; watershed interconnect (until recently this option was forbidden, it would technically be an inter-basin transfer of waters of the USA); reservoirs (Addicks, Barker, and a reservoir proposed on Sims bayou); flood thrusters (axial flow pumps submerged in the bayous); flood corridors (set aside land adjacent to known flood paths and prohibit development; this is a FEMA preferred approach); salt dome storage; residential storage (require all property owners to detain 2-inches of water for 24 hours during any event).\n",
    "\n",
    "Obvious from this list of concepts, flooding is a huge economic issue, with huge mitigation costs that only reduce loss of service time. The photo gallery excerpt below illustrates the kind of economics involved. To be fair to the leaders at the time, the water depths were not preventable, but in hindsight, the community may have been to reduce the damages considerable by better decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](tsallison1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](tsallison2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Low quality for specific use.\n",
    "Groundwater historically has been high quality water in terms of potability, and relatively abundant where surface sources are non-existent. Surface activities have introduced pollutants (organic chemicals) that render the water useless without treatment and wellhead treatment is considered problematic. The general strategy in the last three decades has been to eliminate sources and attempt to slowly restore aquifers to the highest beneficial use. In some cases this approach has led to the pumping, treatment, and re-injection of groundwater without letting it pass through a beneficial use (i.e., it doesn’t go through any kidneys)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Erosion\n",
    "The destructive power of moving water is greatly underestimated by most people, including civil engineers. Erosion is a problem because of loss of expensive infrastructure as well as loss of productive agricultural land. One problem that has emerged in the last century is that our ability to control water using impoundments (dams) has made erosion problems worse in many cases. Locally in Texas we have many water crossings (bridges) in danger of failure or restricted service after relatively common discharge events. The figures below illustrate the erosive force of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](erosion1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sedimentation\n",
    "Sedimentation causes loss of capacity in regulating structures and can block intakes for water supply and hydropower. Dredging can disturb contaminated sediments that have been overlain with clean sediment (a desirable situation and encouraged in the EPA’s sediment management strategy). Sedimentation is the opposite of erosion where solids are mobilized, but often are related. That is materials eroded in one location are deposited elsewhere. In most such cases both processes are undesirable from an infrastructure standpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](sedimentation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regulatory Agencies and Programs\n",
    "Water is regulated by various agencies. Water is both property (ownership is defined), and well as a shared resource (quality and uses are governed). The annotated list below is a sampling of some of the agencies involved in different aspects of water, and thus directly involved in engineering hydrology.\n",

    "\n",
    "The water, or hydrologic, cycle describes the journey of water as water molecules make their way from the Earth’s surface to the atmosphere and back again, in some cases to below the surface. This gigantic system, powered by energy from the Sun, is a continuous exchange of moisture between the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land.\n",
    "A typical diagram depicting the hydrologic cycle is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](hydrologic_cycle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The driving force for the cycle is solar energy that provides the energy to vaporize liquid water that then rises into clouds, moves onshore, and rains (or snow, sleet, $\\dots$.  and other forms of <strong>precipitation</strong>)\n",
    "A portion of the rain becomes runoff, another portion returns to the atmosphere as evaporation, another portion infiltrates into the ground and becomes groundwater.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more detailed accounting of the precipitation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A portion known as interception is retained on buildings, vegetation, and other surfaces that eventually evaporates - the remaining quantity is called **effective precipitation**\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Excess precipitation is a similar concept.  When discussing rainfall-runoff processes using some model (i.e. unit hydrograph methods), the quantity that becomes runoff is called excess precipitation.  The terms are frequently used interchangeably.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Some of the effective precipitation also evaporates directly.\n",
    "3. Another portion of effective precipitation **infiltrates** into the ground - a portion of infiltrated water returns to the atmosphere via transpiration, the remainder either percolates deeper into the ground or is incorporated in the vegetative biomass.\n",
    "4. The water that percolates deeper into the ground becomes **recharge** to the groundwater system, and may appear at some point as **baseflow** in streams.\n",
    "5. If the precipitation exceeds the combined evaporation and infiltration puddles form in small depressions on the land surface - this is called depression storage.\n",
    "6. After the depressions are filled they join and a continuous film of water can begin to flow over the surface to a stream channel.  This portion that can flow is called the **excess precipitation** (see the note above), and the flow is called the **direct runoff**.\n",
    "7. Runoff occurs when the film of water begins to move - water in this film is said to be in **detention storage**, and evaporation occurs from this compartment too. When precipitation ceases, the water in detention storage eventually joins the stream channel.\n",
    "8. The destination of all streams is open bodies of water such as lakes, seas, and oceans which are subject to substantial evaporation.\n",
    "9. The evaporation and tanspiration from all these sources combine and carry moisture back into the atmosphere which condenses and repeats the cycle.\n"
