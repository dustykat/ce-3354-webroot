    "## The Rational Method (Q = CiA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rational Method is one of the oldest and most widely used techniques in engineering hydrology to estimate peak runoff discharge from small watersheds, particularly in urban environments. It’s valued for its simplicity and direct application in drainage design.\n",

    "$$Q_p = C i A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $Q_p$ = peak runoff rate (typically in cubic feet per second or cubic meters per second)<br>\n",
    "- $C$ = runoff coefficient (dimensionless)<br>\n",
    "- $i$= rainfall intensity (in/hr or mm/hr) for a duration equal to the time of concentration<br>\n",
    "- $A$ = drainage area (acres or hectares)<br>\n",
    "\n",

    "Key Applications\n",
    "1. Sizing storm sewers and culverts\n",
    "2. Designing detention basins for small developments (using Modified Rational Method)\n",
    "3. Estimating peak discharge for roadside ditches\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions and Limitations\n",
    "1. Assumes uniform rainfall over the area\n",
    "2. Most appropriate for small watersheds (< 200 acres or ~80 ha)\n",
    "3. The rainfall intensity must correspond to the time of concentration (Tc)\n",

    "The Curve Number Method was developed by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service (now NRCS), the Curve Number (CN) Method estimates direct runoff depth from rainfall events using empirical relationships based on land use, soil type, and hydrologic condition.

    "## Concept of Hydrographs and Peak Flow Estimation\n",
    "A hydrograph is a time series plot that shows how streamflow or discharge varies over time at a particular point in a watershed, typically following a rainfall event. It reflects the integrated response of a watershed to precipitation, modulated by surface and subsurface flow processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](HydrographImage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The idealized hydrograph (above) is divided into:\n",
    "- Rising limb: where discharge increases rapidly due to incoming runoff\n",
    "- Peak flow: the highest point of the hydrograph, representing the maximum discharge\n",
    "- Recession limb: the gradual decrease in flow as runoff and baseflow subside\n",
    "\n",
    "In engineering hydrology, peak flow estimation is crucial for:\n",
    "1. Designing culverts, bridges, detention ponds\n",
    "2. Urban drainage systems\n",
    "3. Flood risk assessments\n",
    "\n",
    "A Unit Hydrograph (UH) is a special type of hydrograph function that represents the response (in discharge) of a watershed to 1 inch (or 1 mm) of effective rainfall uniformly distributed over the basin for a specified duration.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} \n",
    "Once a unit hydrograph is known, it can be scaled and convolved with rainfall excess to predict runoff hydrographs for any storm, allowing flexible design under varied rainfall conditions.\n",
