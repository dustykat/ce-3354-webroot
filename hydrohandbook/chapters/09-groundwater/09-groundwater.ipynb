    "The static or piezometric head at a point in a groundwater system is the elevation of the top of a column of water that can be supported above that point (see Figure 4.2 on pg. 121). The density of the water in the measuring column is assumed to be equal to that of the groundwater, and the density of the groundwater is assumed to be uniform.\n",

    "- Head consists of two terms in a groundwater system: the elevation of the point of interest, and the height of a column of water that can be supported above that point.\n",

    "Consider a pipe driven into the ground. The bottom of the pipe comes to rest at a point below the water table where the fluid pressure is $p$. Water rises in the pipe to a height $h_p$ above the lower end of the pipe. The pressure at the top of the water column in the pipe is zero (gage). The height of the column of water in the pipe expressed in terms of fluid density, pressure, and the gravitational constant is the piezometric (pressure) head at the bottom of the pipe.\n",

    "In this fashion, $h_p$ is actually a measure of the pressure in the fluid at the lower end of the pipe. The sum of this pressure head and the elevation head (height of the bottom of the pipe above a datum) is the static head in an aquifer.\n",

This potential is equal to the amount of work required to raise one unit weight of water from the datum to point $O$. For instance, if $z$ is 10 meters, and 10 Newtons of water is raised from the datum elevation to point $O$, then 100 Newton-meters (N-m) of work would be required. Conversely, if 10 Newtons of water were allowed to fall from point $O$ back to the datum, this weight of water could perform 100 N-m of work.\n",

    "### Pressure Head\n",
    "The pressure term also represents a capacity to do work.  Pressure is usually expressed as force per unit area. However pressure can also be expressed as work per unit volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](pressurework.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of illustrating the alternate expression of pressure is to consider a hydraulic cylinder. The figure is a schematic of a hydraulic press.  Liquid under pressure $p$ is fed into the cylinder through the port at $O$. As the liquid enters, the piston is displaced to the right. Pressure is force per unit area, so the total force on the piston is the product of pressure $p$ and piston face area $A$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The work required to move the piston through the distance $d$ is the product of force and distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ W = F d = p \\times A \\times d$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The product of piston area $A$ and distance $d$ is a volume; thus the ability of the volume of liquid $Ad$ to perform work $W$ is given by the fluid pressure $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential energy is the ability to do work. In the hydraulic piston example, the potential energy per unit volume of liquid that is allowed to enter the piston is the pressure.  This concept of potential energy can be extended to many kinds of flow systems provided that one understands that the potential is only from forces exerted on a fluid element by the surrounding fluid. To obtain total potential, one needs to add potential energy from the force of gravity, from chemical forces, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many groundwater problems, only the pressure potential and the gravity potential are important, and the other potentials can be neglected. If the pressure, representing potential energy per unit volume, is divided by the specific weight of the fluid, $ρg$, then one obtains the term\n",

    "$$ h_p = \\frac{p}{\\rho g} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Velocity Head\n",
    "\n",
    "The last important term is kinetic energy, or the energy from motion. In particle mechanics, the kinetic energy is the product of mass and the square of velocity divided by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ KE = \\frac{mU^2}{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a fluid, we represent kinetic energy as the mass per unit volume (V) of fluid moving at the specified velocity (u).\n",

    "In a groundwater system the flow velocities are usually small and the square of these velocities is even smaller. Thus the kinetic energy terms are usually negligible when compared to the pressure and elevation potentials.\n",
