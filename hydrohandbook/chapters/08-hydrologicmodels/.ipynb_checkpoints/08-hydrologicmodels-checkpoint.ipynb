    "Hydrologic models are indispensable tools in both research and practice because the routine, site-specific collection of field data for every watershed or infrastructure project is often impractical and cost-prohibitive. Instead of measuring every component of the water cycle at every location of interest, models allow engineers and scientists to simulate hydrologic behavior using a combination of limited field data, physical laws, and conceptual or empirical relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "At their core, models are simplified representations of the real world. They aim to capture the essential characteristics of a natural system — especially the relationship between inputs (such as rainfall or snowmelt) and outputs (such as streamflow or infiltration). A good hydrologic model preserves the cause-and-effect, or excitation–response, behavior of the system it represents, even if it omits many secondary details. This simplification enables engineers to predict how a watershed or aquifer will behave under both historical and hypothetical scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter focuses on two widely used modeling systems for surface water hydrology:\n",
    "\n",
    "HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Modeling System), developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is commonly used for rainfall-runoff modeling, flood forecasting, and **watershed-scale** planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "EPA-SWMM (Storm Water Management Model), developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is particularly suited for urban stormwater management, including **drainage network** modeling and green infrastructure evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In European practice, common alternatives include:\n",
    "\n",
    "MIKE SHE, a comprehensive and physically-based modeling system developed by the Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI), which integrates surface water, groundwater, and unsaturated zone flow in a unified framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "HBV (Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning), a conceptual rainfall-runoff model widely used for water resource assessments and flood forecasting across northern and central Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "While surface water models like those described above simulate watershed behavior at or near the ground surface, groundwater hydrology involves modeling the subsurface. This domain requires fundamentally different tools. Groundwater modeling is almost exclusively performed using MODFLOW, a modular finite-difference flow model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey. MODFLOW and its capabilities are discussed in a later chapter of this text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrologic modeling is not a replacement for engineering judgment or data collection, but rather a decision-support tool that helps quantify, interpret, and communicate complex hydrologic behavior. The remaining sections in this chapter walk through the fundamental concepts, data requirements, and practical workflows associated with HEC-HMS and SWMM, and demonstrate their application to representative problems in watershed hydrology."

    "## Hydrologic modeling in Engineering Design\n",
    "\n",
    "In most situations a model refers to representing real-world situations in a mathematical structure that can be solved using a computer. Occasionally a physical or analog model is used in hydrology, but these kinds of models are becoming more and more rare because of the time and cost involved. Well constructed computer models (not just the program) can often do an excellent job of modeling, although some problems are geometrically complex enough to justify physical or analog modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "With computer modeling a large number of variables and/or a large amount of data can be relatively quickly manipulated, increasing the chances of an accurate and defendable answer to the particular question (that the model was built to answer).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in developing any hydrologic model is the development of a **conceptual model**. During this stage of model development the existing are assembled. This data includes, but is not limited to, water company data on withdrawal rates and water levels; state and municipal well-permitting information; and previously published reports and maps. The documents are then reviewed to determine the system boundaries; extent and thickness of hydrologic units; aquifer recharge; ground water and surface water elevations; stream discharge and leakage to aquifers; aquifer parameters; and other characteristics unique to the situation to be modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually some fieldwork will be necessary to fill in the gaps. A data collection plan is prepared that sets out the field strategy for additional data collection. When the fieldwork is complete, the existing and new data are analyzed. The existing conceptual model is then revised and updated to incorporate data from the field program. This step ensures that all previously identified data needs have been satisfied and serves as a springboard for the computer modeling effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the conceptual model in place, it's time to select the model code or computer program to be used for the well head protection simulations. Some states require the use of a particular code. In most cases, several modeling codes are available that are capable of adequately modeling the problem. The choice should be based, if possible, on the modeler’s preference, although consideration must be given to what the relevant agency personnel are familiar with, otherwise, considerable time and money may be spent defending your code and training agency personnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the flow model code has been selected, the boundaries and parameters identified in the conceptual model are put into a form suitable for modeling. This step includes determining the number of model layers, design of the model grid, determining the initial values of parameters and hydrologic stresses, and setting boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of calibration is to establish that the model can reproduce field-measured values. This procedure is done by adjusting the model parameters (hydraulic conductivity, storage coefficient, etc.) and stresses (recharge, up land underflow, etc.) to produce the best match between simulated and observed water related variables."

    "Hydrograph routing is a technique used in computational hydrology to predict the temporal distribution of water flow in rivers, channels, and reservoirs in response to inflow events. It involves calculating the downstream movement of water through a channel or watershed, accounting for the storage and movement of water within the system. The primary objective is to determine the changes in flow characteristics, such as discharge, over time and space as water travels from upstream to downstream points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical applications, hydrograph routing is used for flood forecasting, design of hydraulic structures, and water resource management. There are two main types of routing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hydrologic Routing: This approach uses simplified methods based on the conservation of mass and empirical relationships. Techniques such as the Muskingum method, kinematic wave model, and unit hydrograph are common. Hydrologic routing is often used for its simplicity and efficiency, particularly in cases where detailed data is not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hydraulic Routing: This method uses the principles of fluid mechanics, typically the continuity equation and the momentum equation (Saint-Venant equations), to model the movement of water through a channel. It provides detailed information about flow depth and velocity but requires comprehensive data and computational effort.  (These techniques are introduced and applied in CE 3372 and are the subject of the entire course CE 4353)\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "In the context of HEC-HMS, this background serves as a natural precursor to building models with multiple interconnected sub-basins. Routing represents the mechanism by which information—specifically, flow—is transmitted from one component to the next. As you work through the examples, remember that the actual computations are carried out within HEC-HMS, not in our homebrew scripts or spreadsheets, even though the underlying algorithms are the same.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrograph routing informs how different factors, such as channel shape, roughness, and basin characteristics, influence the timing and magnitude of peak flows. The results are critical for designing effective flood control measures, optimizing reservoir operations, and designing suitable drainage systems.\n",

    "In this folder are rainfall-runofff data for three storms on Ash Creek watershed in Dallas, Texas.  \n",
    "Included are some base maps to help locate the watershed.  \n",
    "The maps are simply PDF files and are not georeferenced, so other than pretty pictures the maps are useless.\n",

    "Using HEC HMS model the Ash Creek Watershed using a loss model of your choice and a transformation model of your choice.  Model the watershed as a lumped system (one sub-basin, no routing).\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Estimate parameter values in the model without using the time-series data (synthetic hydrology).  Document how you make the estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Test your estimated with the 1973_0603 storm, how well did your synthetic approach perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Use the 1973_0603 storm to \"calibrate\" your model.  Trial-and-error is appropriate, or you chould choose the internal calibration tools in HMS, also your choice.  Demonstrate the calibrated model by capturing the model output for the storm (i.e. a time series of computed and observed discharge).   Use the weighted accumulated precipitation is the input (since we don't have the raingage locations).\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Test the calibrated model with the other two storms (DO NOT CHANGE PARAMETERS IN THE MODEL).   Assess model performance with thses other two real storms.  What do you conclude?\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Now try to adjust the parameters to obtain a best \"average\" performance.  What do you conclude?\n",
    "\n",
    "(6-8) Repeat steps 3-5 with the watershed subdivided into multiple sub-basins, with routing.    Use any subdivision scheme you think is appropriate, but use at least 3 sub-basins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did subdivision confer any performance advantage?   At what cost?\n",

    "Linear Quasi-Distributed Runoff Transform (ModClark) Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Linear Quasi-Distributed Runoff Transform, commonly referred to as the ModClark model, is an advanced method for simulating the transformation of rainfall into runoff within a watershed. It is an extension of the Clark Unit Hydrograph method, integrating the concepts of spatial variability and distributed hydrologic response.\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Spatial Variability: Unlike traditional lumped models that treat the watershed as a single unit, the ModClark model incorporates spatial variability by dividing the watershed into multiple grid cells. Each grid cell has unique hydrologic properties, allowing for a more detailed and realistic representation of the watershed's response to rainfall.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Grid-Based Approach: The watershed is discretized into a grid, where each cell's excess rainfall is computed and routed to the watershed outlet. The routing is done using a combination of translation (movement of water from one cell to another) and storage (delays in flow due to channel and overland flow characteristics).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Rainfall Distribution: The ModClark model can account for non-uniform rainfall distribution across the watershed. This is particularly useful for large or complex watersheds where precipitation may vary significantly in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time-Area Concept: The model employs a time-area histogram, similar to the Clark Unit Hydrograph method, to represent the travel time distribution of water from different parts of the watershed to the outlet. The time-area curve is derived from the grid structure and flow path characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Linear Reservoir Concept: The model uses a linear reservoir approach to simulate storage and attenuation effects. The linear reservoir coefficient and time of concentration are key parameters that influence the shape and timing of the runoff hydrograph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ModClark model is particularly useful in situations where spatial variability in rainfall and watershed characteristics play a significant role in the runoff response. It is often used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Flood forecasting and floodplain management.\n",
    "    Urban hydrology, where impervious surfaces and drainage networks create complex runoff patterns.\n",
    "    Watershed management and planning, where detailed understanding of hydrologic processes is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Enhanced Accuracy: By accounting for spatial variability and detailed hydrologic response, the ModClark model provides a more accurate representation of runoff generation and routing compared to lumped models.\n",
    "    Flexibility: The model can be adapted to various scales and complexities of watersheds, making it a versatile tool for hydrologists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data Requirements: The model requires detailed spatial data for accurate representation, including grid-based rainfall, land cover, and topography.\n",
    "    Computational Demand: The grid-based approach and detailed routing can be computationally intensive, especially for large watersheds or long simulation periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the ModClark model is a powerful tool for hydrologic modeling, offering a quasi-distributed approach that captures the spatial heterogeneity of watersheds and improves the accuracy of runoff predictions."

    "\n",
    "The [EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM)](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm#software%20and%20compatibility) is a comprehensive software tool developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for simulating the quantity and quality of stormwater runoff in urban areas. First developed in 1971, SWMM has become one of the most widely used models for planning, analyzing, and designing urban drainage systems, including storm sewers, combined sewers, and other conveyance systems. Its ability to simulate dynamic rainfall-runoff relationships, along with pollutant transport, makes it a key tool for engineers working on stormwater management, flood control, and water quality improvement projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "SWMM allows users to model the physical processes involved in stormwater runoff, including rainfall, infiltration, evaporation, and surface flow, as well as the behavior of drainage networks under varying conditions. The model supports continuous or event-based simulation, which enables long-term studies of stormwater systems under different climate conditions. Additionally, SWMM includes a variety of features for modeling green infrastructure practices such as permeable pavement, rain gardens, and green roofs, which are essential for sustainable stormwater management. Its versatility and ability to incorporate both conventional and innovative infrastructure make it an invaluable tool for engineers tasked with addressing complex urban water challenges.\n",
