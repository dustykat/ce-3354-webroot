Quiz: Watershed Characteristics and Time of Concentration
What is a watershed boundary?
A) A network of streams in a region
B) The line dividing one drainage basin from another

Answer: B

Which factor most directly affects the total runoff volume from a watershed?
A) Slope
B) Land use

D) Watershed area
Answer: D

In engineering hydrology, slope is important because it affects:
