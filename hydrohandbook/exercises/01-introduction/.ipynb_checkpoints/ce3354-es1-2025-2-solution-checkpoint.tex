\item Figure \ref{fig:farmland} is a schematic of a 600-hectare farm; the land receives annual rainfall of 2500 mm.  There is a river flowing through the farm land with inflow rate of 5 m$^3$/s and outflow rate of 4m$^3$/s.  The annual water storage in the farm land increases by 2.5$\times$10$^6$m$^3$.  Using the water budget concept, estimate the annual evaporation amount in millimeters.\footnote{1 hectare = 10,000 m$^2$}

\item A reservoir has a surface area of 690 acres.  Figure \ref{fig:reservoir} shows the monthly inflow of surface water, outflows as releases from the reservoir via the spillway, direct precipitation into the reservoir, and evaporation from the reservoir.  The reservoir water surface elevation was 701.0 feet on January 1.  Determine the reservoir water surface elevation at the end of each month (i.e. complete the table)

\item The equation $k\frac{dQ}{dt} + Q(t) = I(t)$ is used to describe the response of streamflow to a constant rate of precipitation applied indefinitely on some watershed.  
Suppose that $Q(0)=0$ and the watershed characteristic time constant is $k=2~\text{hrs}$.
$I(t) =2$ for $t=[0,12)~\text{hrs}$ and then $I(t) =0$ for $t=[12,24]~\text{hrs}.$ 

Determine:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Plot the values of $I(t)$ over the 24-hour perios, in 1-hour increments.
\item The necessary equation(s) to predict the response $Q(t)$ over the 24-hour period.
\item Plot the values of $Q(t)$ over the 24-hour period, in 1-hour increments.
\end{enumerate}

Solution(s):

Use calculus, and by separation and integration determine the following expression

Define inflow \( I(t) \) and outflow \( Q(t) \) as:

\[
I(t) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{for } t < 0 \\
2 & \text{for } 0 \leq t < \tau \\
0 & \text{for } t \geq \tau
\end{cases}
\]

\[
Q(t) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{for } t \leq 0 \\
2\left[1 - e^{-t/k}\right] & \text{for } 0 < t \leq \tau \\
2\left[1 - e^{-t/k}\right] - 2\left[1 - e^{-(t - \tau)/k}\right] & \text{for } t > \tau
\end{cases}
\]

where \( \tau = 12 \) hours and \( k \) is the reservoir coefficient (e.g., in hours).

Alternatively create a finite-difference approximation as

$k\frac{dQ}{dt} + Q(t) = I(t)$

Move $Q(t)$ to RHS and divide by $k$

$\frac{dQ}{dt}  = \frac{I(t)-Q(t)}{k}$

Then express the LHS as a difference quotient

$\frac{Q(t+\Delta t) - Q(t)}{\Delta t}  = \frac{I(t)-Q(t)}{k}$

Isolate everything at the old time step to the RHS

$Q(t+\Delta t)  = Q(t)  + \frac{\Delta t}{k} (I(t)-Q(t))$

Code up into a spreadsheet, choose a small enough value of $\Delta t$ and proceede.

\item A farm has a reservoir with vertical sides and surface area of 2.5 acres. Following the reservoir has accumulated 9.84 feet of water.  During the dry season the reservoir loses 2.5 inches of water per week to evaporation.  The average irrigation demand during the dry season is 0.23 acre-ft per day.

    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
        \item How many weeks can the farm irrigate water from the reservoir supply?
