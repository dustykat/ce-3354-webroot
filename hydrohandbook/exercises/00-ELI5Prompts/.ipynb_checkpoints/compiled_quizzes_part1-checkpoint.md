# Quiz: Water on Pavement and Urban Runoff

**1. What is the main difference in how water behaves on grass versus pavement?**

- A. Water evaporates faster on grass
- B. Water infiltrates into pavement but not into grass
- C. Grass absorbs water like a sponge, while pavement causes water to run off
- D. Pavement filters the water while grass collects debris

**Correct Answer:** C

**2. What term describes water that flows over paved surfaces and collects debris?**

- A. Infiltration
- B. Evapotranspiration
- C. Runoff
- D. Condensation

**Correct Answer:** C

**3. What is one consequence of storm drains being clogged with trash and debris?**

- A. The water gets filtered before reaching rivers
- B. Runoff is reduced and flooding is avoided
- C. Water backs up and may cause flooding
- D. More green spaces are formed

**Correct Answer:** C

**4. What is the purpose of the Rational Method in urban drainage design?**

- A. To predict air temperature and evaporation
- B. To estimate water usage in homes
- C. To calculate how much water can be stored in lakes
- D. To estimate runoff and help size drainage systems

**Correct Answer:** D

**5. Which of the following is typically used to reduce runoff and increase infiltration in urban areas?**

- A. Asphalt overlays
- B. Impervious concrete
- C. Permeable pavement
- D. Tar sealants
