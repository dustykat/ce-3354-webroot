ELI5 Explanation Prompts for Engineering Hydrology

1. How rain turns into runoff
2. What a watershed is and why it matters
3. What the time of concentration tells us
4. Why curve numbers help us predict flooding
5. How soil type affects flooding risk
6. What happens to water when it hits pavement
7. How a hydrograph tells the story of a storm
8. What infiltration means (and why it’s like a sponge)
9. Why we use the Rational Method
10. How detention basins help control floods 
11. What “return period” really means for storms
12. Why cities flood faster than forests
13. What the Green-Ampt model tells us
14. How evaporation and transpiration remove water
15. Why engineers need to know about baseflow
16. What we mean by ‘design storm’
17. How a rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curve works
18. Why stream gauges matter for flood prediction
19. What happens to water underground (groundwater basics)
20. How rain barrels and green roofs reduce runoff
21. What pervious vs. impervious surfaces mean
22. Why small storms can still be dangerous
23. How land use changes affect flood risk
24. What peak discharge is—and why we care
