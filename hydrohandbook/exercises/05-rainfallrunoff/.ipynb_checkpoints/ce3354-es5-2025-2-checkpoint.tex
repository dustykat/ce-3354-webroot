\begin{enumerate}

\item a 50-acre single-family residential subdivision receives a rainfall intensity of 3 inches per hour for one hour.  The average runoff coefficient is 0.50.  Using a rational triangular hydrograph \footnote{Essentially apply the Modified Rational Method with $t_c$ equal to the storm duration} 

Determine:
    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
        \item Maximum (peak) discharge rate for the watershed.
        \item A plot of the discharge hydrograph in 6-minute intervals.
        \item The total volume of runoff from the subdivision for the entire storm.
    \end{enumerate}

\item a 50-acre single-family residential subdivision receives a rainfall intensity of 3 inches per hour for one hour.  The average runoff coefficient is 0.50.  Using the NRCS triangular hydrograph \footnote{$t_c$ is set equal to the storm duration} 

Determine:
    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
        \item Maximum (peak) discharge rate for the watershed.
        \item A plot of the discharge hydrograph in 6-minute intervals.
        \item The total volume of runoff from the subdivision for the entire storm.
    \end{enumerate}

\item A watershed is comprised of sandy soil with a 500 foot path to an outlet.  The slope on that path is 5-percent.  The soil has a high water table limiting the potential watershed storage to 0.5 inches.  Using the NRCS Lag Equation method\footnote{\url{https://directives.nrcs.usda.gov/sites/default/files2/1712930818/31754.pdf}}

\begin{equation}
T_c = L^{0.8} \frac{(S_r + 1)^{0.7}}{1140 Y^{0.5}}
\end{equation}

%1900 in denominator replaced with 1140 in 2021 version

where: \\
\mytab $T_c$ = time of concentration, hr \\
\mytab $L$ = flow length, ft \\
\mytab $S_r$ = Potential storage (in.); $S_r = \frac{1000}{CN}-10$ \\
\mytab $CN$ = NRCS runoff curve number \\
\mytab $Y$ = average watershed slope, \% \\


Determine:
    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
        \item Time of concentration ($T_c$).
    \end{enumerate}

\item The runoff hydrograph below was produced by a 100 acre watershed.

        \item Excess precipitation in watershed inches for the hydrograph.
        \item A unit hydrograph for the watershed.

%\item Problem 7.3.5 in Mays, pg. 278.

\item An agricultural watershed was urbanized over a 20 year interval.  A triangular one-hour unit hydrograph was developed for this watershed for an excess rainfall duration of one hour.  

Before urbanization, the average loss rate was 0.30 in/hr.  

Figure \ref{fig:UnitGraph1} is the unit hydrograph that has a peak discharge of 400 cfs/in occurring at 3 hours, and a base time of 9 hours.

   \caption{Pre-Urbanization unit hydrograph for excess rainfall of 1 in/hr for 1 hour.}
   \label{fig:UnitGraph1}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

After urbanization the loss rate was reduced to 0.15 in/hr and the peak discharge of the unit hydrograph increased to 600 cfs/in occurring at 1 hour, and the base time reduced to 6 hours.    Figure \ref{fig:UnitGraph2} is the unit hydrograph with a peak discharge of 600 cfs occurring at 1 hours, and a time base of 6 hours.

\end{figure}

For a two hour storm in which 1 inch of rain fell in the first hour and 0.5 inch in the second hour, determine the direct runoff hydrographs before and after urbanization.\footnote{This exercise is the same as problem 7.5.7, pg. 238 in Chow, Maidment, Mays}

\clearpage

\item A storm on April 16, 1977, on the Shoal Creek watershed at Northwest Park in
Austin, Texas, resulted in the rainfall-runoff values in Figure \ref{fig:RainRunoff1}.

Use the linear regression method to determine the half-hour unit hydrograph for the watershed. 
The watershed drainage area is 7.03 $mi^2$.
Assume that a uniform loss rate (constant loss model) is valid.\footnote{This exercise is a hybrid of problems 7.6.2 and 7.6.5, pg  239 in Chow, Maidment, and Mays.}
