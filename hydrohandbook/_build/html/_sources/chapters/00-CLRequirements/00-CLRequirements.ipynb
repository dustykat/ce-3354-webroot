    "## Purpose and Implementation for Engineering Hydrology (CE 3354)\n",
    "In alignment with Texas Tech University's [Communication Literacy (CL) requirement](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/provost/curriculum/communication-literacy/index.php), this course equips students with essential communication skills tailored to the professional practice of civil and environmental engineering. Recognizing that hydrologic analysis must be conveyed not only through technical reports but also through clear visualizations and accessible explanations, the course includes structured assignments designed to foster clarity, fluency, and audience awareness across multiple communication modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the asynchronous distance format of this course, classical modalities such as in-person team presentations are not feasible. While a design report remains possible, collaborative authorship across remote locations presents significant logistical challenges. Instead, students will complete a series of individual communication artifacts to demonstrate their communication literacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CL-specific activities in this course include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Video-style explanations** that demonstrate the ability to explain “how-to” hydrologic concepts for technical or non-technical audiences. This activity emphasizes presentation fluency in a distance-compatible format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ELI5-style written explanations** that simplify complex hydrologic topics for non-specialist readers, reflecting the Feynman Method’s emphasis on learning through explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Annotated technical graphs** that showcase student proficiency in visual communication and the interpretation of hydrologic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Infographics** that visually communicate watershed, soil, or runoff relationships in a format accessible to decision-makers, policymakers, or the general public.\n",
    "\n",
    "These assignments reflect the transactional nature of engineering communication, requiring students to adapt their messages to suit diverse audiences and platforms. Through this curriculum, students develop proficiency in discipline-specific communication and gain the professional literacy needed to function ethically and effectively in a global, interdisciplinary context."
