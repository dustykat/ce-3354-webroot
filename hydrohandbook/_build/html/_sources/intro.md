# Engineering Hydrology

Engineering hydrology is dedicated to theory and application of hydrologic concepts as they apply to the built environment.  The scale ranges from tiny (parking space) to huge (Colorado River Basin); the goals similar - reduce damage from innundation(flooding), collect sufficient supply to serve human needs or, frequently, both.  Students will learn how to use predictive tools such as charts and computer programs, and apply these tools to the analysis and design of collection and drainage systems. Preparation of a professional report is a component of this course.

## Institutional Users

Users wishing to replicate this book (and supporting website) can clone the current copy from [https://github.com/dustykat/ce-3354-webroot](https://github.com/dustykat/ce-3354-webroot).  Install into your webroot into a web directory named `/your_webroot/ce-3354-webroot/` (on my machine I use a symbolic link, you have to configure `apache2` or `nginx` to allow this structure) Then you will have to manually (use `sed`) change all instances of `http://54.243.252.9/...` to your webroot.  All internal links should then work; external resources can be left alone.  You then will need to rebuild the JupyterBook.  You should probably modify both the citation and the copyright to reflect any changes you make to the content.
