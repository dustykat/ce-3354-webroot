    "\n",
    "If gauge data are not available at the design location, discharge values can be estimated by transposition if a peak flow-frequency curve is available at a nearby gauged location. This method is appropriate for hydrologically similar watersheds that differ in area by less than 50 percent, with outlet locations less than 100 miles apart.\n",

    "- $A_2$ = Area of watershed 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Transposition of peak flow is demonstrated with the following example. A designer requires an estimate of the 1% AEP streamflow at an ungauged location with drainage area of 200 square miles. A nearby (within 100 miles) stream gauge has a hydrologically similar drainage area of 450 square miles. The 1% AEP peak streamflow at the gauged location is 420 cfs based on the peak flow-frequency curve developed for that location. Substituting into Equation 4-10 results in 280 cfs as an estimate of the 1% AEP peak discharge at the ungauged location:\n",
    "\n",
    "If flow-frequency curves are available at multiple gauged sites, Equation 4-10 can be used to estimate the desired peak AEP flow from each site. Then, with judgment and knowledge of the watersheds, those estimates could be weighted to provide an estimate of the desired AEP flow at the ungauged location. This process should be well documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design of a storage facility, such as a detention pond, may require estimates of AEP flows for longer durations. If a flow-frequency curve for longer flow duration is available at a nearby gauged location, then the following equation, based on an analysis of mean-daily flows , may be used for transposition:\n",

    "## Flood Frequency Analysis (B17C)\n",
    "\n",
    "Flood hydrology is typically studied using the annual peak streamflow data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) at streamgages. Hydraulic design engineers need standard of practice guidance for various tasks involving the analysis and application peak streamflow information. Analyses of this information materially influences bridge design, operational safety of drainage infrastructure, flood-plain management, and other decisions affecting society.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bulletin 17B was the standard of practice for decades, recently superceded by Bulletin [17C](https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/04/b05/tm4b5.pdf).  These and similar tools relate certain statistical metrics (mean, variance, and skew) to a prescribed probability distribution function (Log-Pearson Type III) to extrapolate (predict) the magnitude of rare (low probability) events to inform engineering design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasker and Stedinger (1986) developed a weighted least squares (WLS) procedure for estimating regional skewness coefficients based on sample skewness coefficients for the logarithms of annual peak-streamflow data. Their method of regional analysis of skewness estimators accounts for the precision of the skewness estimator for each streamgage, which depends on the length of record for each streamgage and the accuracy of an ordinary least squares (OLS) regional mean skewness. These methods automated much of B17B process and were incorporated into software used for streamgage analysis.  \n",
    "Recent updates to B17B in terms of software improvements and different handling of gage statistics (in particular EMA) are incorporated into the current tool [B17C](https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/04/b05/tm4b5.pdf)\n",

    "\n",
    "Software is employed because the Pearson Type III distribution is  applied to model streamflow, precipitation extremes, and flood frequency because it can accommodate the **skewness** (3rd moment) observed in these datasets. For example, the Log-Pearson Type III distribution, where data is logarithmically transformed, is used by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for flood frequency analysis, helping hydrologists estimate the probability of extreme flood events (e.g., 100-year floods).\n",
    "\n",
    "By adjusting parameters such as mean, variance, and skewness, Pearson distributions can fit a wide range of data types - but the fitting itself is complex and requires a lot of tedious computations - just the thing for a computer program to do the heavy lifting.
