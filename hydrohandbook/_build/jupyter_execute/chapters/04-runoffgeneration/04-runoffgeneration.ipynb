    "## Runoff Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "The generation of runoff is typically explained by either an excess of precipitation above infiltration capacity (Hortonian overland flow) or by an excess of saturation above soil storage capacity (Dunne overland flow).  There are certainly more explainations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These two have some historical importance in hydrologic science, so will be examined further.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hortonian Overland Flow: Excess Precipitation Mechanism of Runoff Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Hortonian overland flow, named after hydrologist Robert E. Horton, refers to a process where rainfall intensity exceeds the soil's infiltration capacity, resulting in excess water flowing over the land surface. First formalized in Horton’s seminal paper “The Role of Infiltration in the Hydrologic Cycle” (1933), this mechanism remains foundational in hydrology and watershed modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts\n",
    "**Infiltration Capacity Curve:** Horton postulated that soil infiltration capacity decreases over time during a storm event, starting from a high initial value and asymptotically approaching a minimum. When rainfall intensity surpasses this curve, the soil cannot absorb the water fast enough, leading to surface runoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Threshold Behavior:** Unlike saturation-excess runoff (which depends on the soil becoming fully saturated), Hortonian flow is intensity-driven. It can occur even when the soil is relatively dry, provided that the rainfall rate is sufficiently high.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical conditions where Hortonian flow models observed behavior well includes:\n",
    "1. Arid or semi-arid regions\n",
    "2. Urban areas with impervious surfaces\n",
    "3. Steep slopes with compacted or crusted soils\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical Representation\n",
    "Horton's infiltration model is typically written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(t)=f_c+(f_0 - f_c)e^{-kt}$$\n",
    " \n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $f(t)$ = infiltration rate at time $t$\n",
    "- $f_0$ = initial infiltration rate\n",
    "- $f_c$ = asymptotic (minimum) infiltration rate\n",
    "- $k$   = is a decay constant related to how quickly the soil reaches the asymptotic rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Runoff (overland flow) occurs when the rainfall rate $P(t)$ exceeds $f(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](HortonFlowImage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram shows rainfall falling onto the land surface, with part infiltrating into the soil and the excess forming overland flow when the infiltration capacity is exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications and Relevance\n",
    "- Urban Hydrology: Predicting flood peaks from impervious areas.\n",
    "- Soil Erosion Models: Hortonian flow contributes to detachment and transport of sediments.\n",
    "- Runoff Modeling Tools: SWMM, HEC-HMS, and other hydrologic models incorporate Horton-based infiltration options."

    "### Dunne Saturation Excess Overland Flow: A Soil Saturation Mechanism of Runoff\n",
    "\n",
    "Dunne overland flow, named after Thomas Dunne, describes a process where water flows over land surfaces not because of intense rainfall, but because the soil has become fully saturated. Once the soil’s pores are filled to capacity, any additional rainfall—no matter how light—becomes surface runoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept was formalized through Dunne’s field studies in humid, vegetated catchments, most notably in his 1978 work with Luna Leopold.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts\n",
    "**Saturation Before Rainfall:** In Dunne flow, the soil can already be near saturation before a storm begins. Rainfall simply pushes it past the tipping point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lateral Subsurface Flow Contribution:** Saturation often occurs due to lateral water movement, especially downslope, where a convergence of subsurface flow brings soil to full saturation before rainfall arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Location-Specific:** This type of overland flow is most common in:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Humid, forested catchments\n",
    "2. Areas with shallow water tables\n",
    "3. Soils with low permeability at depth\n",
    "\n",
    "![](DunneFlowImage.png)\n",

    "## Watershed Characteristics and Delineation\n",
    "In engineering hydrology, understanding watershed characteristics is fundamental to estimating runoff, designing drainage structures, and managing water resources. The physical parameters of a watershed—its boundaries, area, slope, and land use—strongly influence both the quantity and timing of runoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Watersheds?\n",
    "\n",
    "A watershed is the area of land that drains all the streams and rainfall to a common outlet such as the outflow of a reservoir, mouth of a bay, or any point along a stream channel (this outlet is called a pour-point in GIS-speak). The term “watershed” is often used interchangeably with “drainage basin,” which may make the concept easier to visualize. \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "A common outlet implies that the various discharges have concentrated into a a definable conduit (as opposed to sheet or overland distributed flow).  The distributed flows are part of the watershed, but at times make engineering analysis at smaller scales challenging as no single control point exists.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "A watershed can encompass a small area of land that drains into a trickling creek. It can encompass multiple states in the Midwest, all draining into the Mississippi River. Or it can encompass multiple countries draining into the Atlantic Ocean. No matter where you are standing or sitting right now, you are in a watershed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Water is constantly in motion, be it via ocean currents, precipitation, or slowly moving through underground aquifers. Any given watershed is part of the larger whole of our global water supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smaller watersheds can make up larger watersheds. The Mississippi River has many tributaries (each of which has its own watershed), and in turn empties into the Gulf of Mexico, which connects to the Atlantic Ocean. The U.S. Geological Survey delineates our nation’s watersheds as “Hydrologic Units,” which are assigned hydrologic unit codes. These can range in scale  from expansive water resource regions covering millions of square miles down to tiny local tributary systems. There are 90,000 hydrologic unit codes  designated nationwide. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some more compact definitions of a watershed include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Topographic area that collects and discharges surface streamflow through one outlet or mouth (pour point)\n",
    "- The area on the surface of the Earth that drains to a specific location\n",
    "- In groundwater a similar concept is called a groundwater basin – only the boundaries can move depending on relative rates of recharge and discharge \n",
    "\n",
    "The topographic definition omits that there could be subsurface sewer systems that can cross topographic boundaries.   \n",
    "It’s a big deal in urban areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the artist rendering of a watershed\n",
    "\n",
    "![](watershed.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Large watersheds are comprised of smaller interconnected watersheds, thus in the rendering watershed B is a part of watershed A.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Watershed Boundaries\n",
    "A watershed boundary defines the spatial extent within which all precipitation drains to a common outlet point. These divides follow the highest ridgelines between basins and can often be visualized as the perimeter around a bowl. In hydrological modeling, boundaries are used to isolate contributing areas and apply water balance equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](WatershedBoundary.png)\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{warning} \n",
    "Errors in defining boundaries lead to incorrect estimation of contributing area, distorting runoff predictions and infrastructure design. \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Watershed Area\n",
    "The total area enclosed by a watershed boundary is directly proportional to the volume of runoff generated. Larger watersheds tend to produce greater runoff volumes, although the relationship is moderated by other factors like rainfall intensity, storage, and infiltration.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{warning} \n",
    "Area affects peak discharge calculations and is a key input for Rational Method, SCS Curve Number method, and unit hydrograph methods. \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Watershed Slope\n",
    "Slope determines the velocity of overland and channel flow. Steeper slopes tend to accelerate runoff, reducing infiltration and increasing peak discharges. Slope is typically calculated from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and summarized as average basin slope or main channel slope.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{warning} \n",
    "Steep watersheds are more prone to flash flooding and erosion, requiring more robust energy dissipation in hydraulic design. \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Land Use and Land Cover\n",
    "Land use affects both infiltration and surface roughness. Forested or vegetated land promotes infiltration and delays runoff, while impervious surfaces like roads and rooftops increase runoff volume and reduce lag time.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{warning} \n",
    "Hydrologic models must account for land use when assigning curve numbers, runoff coefficients, or surface roughness values (Manning’s n). \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time of Concentration and Drainage Network Mapping\n",
    "**Time of Concentration ($T_c$)** is defined as the time required for runoff to travel from the most hydraulically distant point in the watershed to the outlet. It represents the upper limit of response time and is essential in designing for peak discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time of concentration is assumed to be comprised of three distinguishable overland flow regimes: sheet flow, shallow concentrated flow, and channelized flow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_c = T_{sheet} + T_{shallow} + T_{channel}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "![](TimeOfConcentration.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Several empirical equations are used to estimate $T_c$, including Kirpich, NRCS, and Kerby formulas, each tuned for different conditions. Engineers select the method based on watershed slope, length, and land use.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{warning} \n",
    "Underestimating $T_c$ leads to overdesigned structures, while overestimating it may result in flood risk due to underestimated peak flows. \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Recent emerging tools can simulate watershed response entirely from statistical-mechanical principles and over time are likely to reduce the reliance on $T_c$ concepts in the future.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "## Drainage Network Mapping\n",
    "The drainage network includes all channels—natural or artificial—within a watershed that convey flow to the outlet. This network governs the routing of water, sediment, and pollutants. It’s typically extracted from high-resolution DEMs using flow direction and accumulation algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} A well-mapped drainage network improves accuracy in hydrograph development, flood modeling, and sediment transport studies.\n",
