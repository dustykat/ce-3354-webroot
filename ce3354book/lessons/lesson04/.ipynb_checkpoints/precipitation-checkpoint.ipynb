    "# Precipitation\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface water hydrology really begins before the precipitate hits the ground.  The form of precipitate is important (rain, sleet, hail, or snow).  For example it takes about 10 inches of snow to produce the same water as 1 inch of rain.  Other factors of importance are the size of the area over which the precipitation falls, the intensity of the precipitation, and its duration.\n",

    "Once the precipitation hits the ground several things can happen.  It can evaporate immediately, especially if the surface is hot, and relatively impervious.  If the surface is dry and/or porous, the precipitate may infiltrate into the ground or may just wet the surface.   The process of just wetting leaves and blades of grass is called interception.  Some of the infiltrated water is returned to the atmosphere by transpiration by plants.  Collectively the return to the atmosphere is called evapotranspiration.  The precipitate may be trapped in small depressions (puddles).  It may remain in these puddles until it evaporates or until the depressions fill and overflow.  Finally it may run off directly to the nearest stream or lake to become surface water.  The four “processes” (evapotranspiration, infiltration, interception, and depression storage) that reduce the amount of precipitation available for direct runoff are collectively called abstractions.  In drainage engineering, the loss model is how we account for these processes.\n",

    "## Engineering Variables of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four variables of engineering interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Intensity: how hard it rains\n",
    "2. Duration: how long it rains at any given intensity\n",
    "3. Frequency: how often it rains at any given intensity and duration\n",
    "4. Spatial Distribution: the rainfall depth over an area\n",
    "\n",
    "Rainfall probabilities are expressed as a combination of frequency (probability), depth, and duration. The inclusion of depth and duration reflects that different “storms” can produce the same total depth, but deliver that depth over much different times \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "A slow gentle rain for a long time versus a hard rain for a short time can have the same total depth, but vastly different hydrologic impact\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "## Depth-Duration-Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "- Depth of rainfall is the accumulated depth (in a gage) over some time interval.\n",
    "- Duration is that time interval.\n",
    "- Frequency is the probability (like AEP) of observing the depth over the given duration."
