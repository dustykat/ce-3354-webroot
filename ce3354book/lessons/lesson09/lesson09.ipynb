    "- Inflection point\n",
    "The hydrograph pictured also has a baseflow component\n",

    "- Time re-distribution implies some kind of transfer behavior is applied\n",
    "- [L. K. Sherman 1932](http://54.243.252.9/ce-3354-webroot/3-Readings/ShermanUH/Sherman_ENR_1932.pdf) is credited with seminal publication of the concept\n",

    "The unit hydrograph is a response function that transforms the distributed input to the outlet, accounting for transit time to get from remote parts of the watershed to the outlet.\n",

    "The time basis matters.  In the figure below a single input of time length D produces the outlet response shown.\n",

    "- Direct runoff duration (time) is same for all uniform-intensity storms of same duration (time)\n",
    "- Two excess hyetographs of the same duration (time) will produce direct runoff hydrographs of the same duration (time) but with runoff rates proportional to the volumes (depth) of the excess hyetographs\n",

    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, each unit hydrograph has a particular duration associated with it, D in the diagram\n",
    "- That duration must coincide with the time step size used in discrete aggregation\n",
    "- Thus a D-hour unit hydrograph is a response to a D-hour “pulse” of excess precipitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow associated with that response is reported every D-hours until there is no further response\n",
    "($T_D$ in the diagram)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each watershed has a characteristic response time, $T_{lag}$ and $T_P$ in the diagram.\n",
    "The characteristic time of the watershed is related to physical characteristics of the watershed contributing area, slope, etc.\n",
    "The time step size for aggregation must the same as the duration, and the time-to-peak for the watershed must be an integer multiple of that value.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "These requirements are coded into HEC-HMS which will issue warnings as these requirements are violated.  As a designer you need to decide whether to ignore the warnings and proceede or adjust inputs and parameters to satisfy the various rules of the signal processing.\n",
