    "The water, or hydrologic, cycle describes the journey of water as water molecules make their way from the Earth’s surface to the atmosphere and back again, in some cases to below the surface. This gigantic system, powered by energy from the Sun, is a continuous exchange of moisture between the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land.\n",

    "The driving force for the cycle is solar energy that provides the energy to vaporize liquid water that then rises into clouds, moves onshore, and rains (or snow, sleet, $\\dots$.  and other forms of <strong>precipitation</strong>)\n",
    "A portion of the rain becomes runoff, another portion returns to the atmosphere as evaporation, another portion infiltrates into the ground and becomes groundwater.\n",

    "## Water Budget Definition\n",
    "The water budget, or <strong>hydrologic balance</strong> is simply the expression of the conservation of mass in hydrologic terms for a hydrologic system.  \n",
    "Generally it is expressed as a rate (or volume) balance.\n",
    "The hydrologic equation is the fundamental tool in hydrology to describe amounts of water in storage in different compartments at different scales.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The equation expressed in “words” is\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate of inflow - Rate of outflow =  Rate of change of storage + Rate of internal mass generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Symbolically it is exrepssed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} - \\frac{dO}{dt} = \\frac{dS}{dt} + \\frac{dG}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$I$ is inflow volume, $O$ is outflow volume, $S$ is storage volume (i.e. within a watershed), and $G$ is generated volume.\n",
    "$G$ is generally zero, but is included to be consistent with the balance equations you have learned elsewhere (i.e. environmental engineering, chemistry, $\\dots$)"
