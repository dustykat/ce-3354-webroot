# # Groundwater Hydrology - I
# 
# Some definitions of a watershed include:
# 
# - Topographic area that collects and discharges surface streamflow through one outlet or mouth (pour point)
# - The area on the surface of the Earth that drains to a specific location
# - In groundwater a similar concept is called a groundwater basin – only the boundaries can move depending on relative rates of recharge and discharge 
# 
# The topographic definition omits that there could be subsurface sewer systems that can cross topographic boundaries.   
# It’s a big deal in urban areas.
