# Engineering Hydrology

Engineering hydrology is dedicated to theory and application of hydrologic concepts as they apply to the built environment.  The scale ranges from tiny (parking space) to huge (Colorado River Basin); the goals similar - reduce damage from innundation(flooding), collect sufficient supply to serve human needs or, frequently, both.  Students will learn how to use predictive tools such as charts and computer programs, and apply these tools to the analysis and design of collection and drainage systems. Preparation of a professional report is a component of this course.
