## Semester Project Problem Statement
Figure 1 is a map of a portion of Concho County, Texas.  In the Southeast corner of the map is Eden, Texas.  A US highway runs nearly East-West through Eden and another US highway runs North-South.  This watershed is the subject of the semester design project.

### Purpose 
The existing culvert system is a 2-barrel 6X6 box-culvert system.  This report presents an hydrologic analysis of the existing system at an appropriate risk level to determine the depth of water at the structure (or overtopping depth), and a determination of the depth of flow if the culvert system is modified by the addition of two more barrels to a total of 4-barrel 6X6 box-culvert system.

## Report Templates:

Report templates are supplied below, the PDF is included becuse it can be rendered on the server through a web browser; use your preferred Word Processor tool.

## Exercise: 
Using the report template; populate (add words and figures) the following sections:

1. Watershed Description: Design Risk Level
2. Watershed Description: Design Storms
3. HEC-HMS Conceptualization: Rainfall-runoff model
3. HEC-HMS Conceptualization: Loss model
 
Cite sources used and put citations in the references section.
