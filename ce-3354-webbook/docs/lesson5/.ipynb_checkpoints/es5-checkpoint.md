Figure 1 below is the gage height and **annual peak discharge** for some gaging station in Oklahoma. The stage is in feet and the discharge is in cubic feet per second. The data are sequential from 1923 through 1971.

# Exercise 1:

1. Plot year versus stage ( x-axis is year).
2. Plot year versus discharge ( x-axis is year).
3. Plot the discharge versus stage.

# Exercise 2:

Is there a correlation between stage and discharge? 

# Exercise 3:

<!--Using the Weibull plotting position formula, determine the distribution parameters that fit the data for a log-normal distribution data model.-->
<!--Using the Weibull plotting position formula, determine the distribution parame-
ters that fit the data for a Gumbell distribution data model.-->
Using the Weibull plotting position formula, determine the distribution parameters that fit the data for a Gamma distribution data model.  Produce a plot of the data and fitted model.

# Exercise 4:
Estimate the discharge associated with a 25-percent chance exceedence probability (i.e. the value that is equal to or exceeded with a 1 in 4 chance) using the Gamma distribution data model.

# Exercise 5:
Use USGS PeakFQ to analyze these data (you will have to manually enter the data).

# Exercise 6:
A resident claims that in the early 1900's a flood corresponding to a stage of 30 feet occurred at the gage location. Estimate the exceedence probability (return period) of the flow assicoated with this event.
