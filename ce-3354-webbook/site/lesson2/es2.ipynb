    "1. Draw the boundary of the entire watershed area (delineate the watershed) that drains to the red circle.  Be sure to include the area of the two regulating structures (the earth berms/dams with riser pipe outlets).\n",
    "2. Determine the drainage area of the watershed in square miles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2: \n",
    "1. Draw the main channel in the watershed (you will have to use some hydrologic judgement).  In GIS the main channel is the path from the highest elevation onthe boundary to the outlet.\n",
    "2. Determine the length of the main channel in miles."
