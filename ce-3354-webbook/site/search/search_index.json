Tour of Blackboard: Quizzes Homework Exams Report Fundamental Concepts What is hydrology? Study of the occurrence, circulation, storage, and distribution of surface and groundwater on the Earth. Engineering hydrology is the quantification of amounts of water at various locations (spatially) as a function of time (temporally) for surface water applications. What is a watershed (catchment)? Here are a couple of definitions of watersheds. Topographic area that collects and discharges surface streamflow through one outlet or mouth (pour point) The area on the surface of the Earth that drains to a specific location In groundwater a similar concept is called a groundwater basin \u2013 only the boundaries can move depending on relative rates of recharge and discharge The topographic definition omits that there could be subsurface sewer systems that can cross topographic boundaries. It\u2019s a big deal in urban areas. What is a hydrologic system? A hydrologic system is just a collection of parts that interact. A hydrologic system is simply the collection of connected components that form the hydrologic cycle These components can be grouped into subsystems, treated separately, and the results combined according to interactions between the subsystems (CMM pg 5) Like in fluid mechanics, the system has boundaries (the control volume) and fluxes into/out of the boundaries. The entire planet is usually considered a closed system (hydrologically) and only the energy fluxes cross the boundary. At more practical scales (parking lot) the mass fluxes matter a lot. What is the hydrologic cycle? Here is a typical diagram depicting the hydrologic cycle. The driving force for the cycle (not shown) is solar energy that provides the energy to vaporize liquid water that then rises into clouds, moves onshore, and rains (or snow, sleet, \\dots . and other forms of precipitation ) A portion of the rain becomes runoff, another portion returns to the atmosphere as evaporation, another portion infiltrates into the ground and becomes groundwater. The surface water system would be the part of the diagram that lies above the plane defined by the ocean and infiltration line. The subsurface system is the part that is below this plane. Expressed as a simple system diagram it would be depicted in the figure below Hydrologic Balance What is a water budget? The water budget, or hydrologic balance is simply the expression of the conservation of mass in hydrologic terms for a hydrologic system. Generally it is expressed as a rate (or volume) balance. The hydrologic equation is the fundamental tool in hydrology to describe amounts of water in storage in different compartments at different scales. The equation expressed in \u201cwords\u201d is Rate of inflow - Rate of outflow = Rate of change of storage + Rate of internal mass generation. Symbolically it is exrepssed as: \\frac{dI}{dt} - \\frac{dO}{dt} = \\frac{dS}{dt} + \\frac{dG}{dt} where I is inflow volume, O is outflow volume, S is storage volume (i.e. within a watershed), and G is generated volume. G is generally zero, but is included to be consistent with the balance equations you have learned elsewhere (i.e. environmental engineering, chemistry, \\dots ) Surface Hydrologic System Here is the surface water system broken into its own sub-system. Notice the dashed line is the boundary \u2013 exactly like a control volume in fluids. Surface Water Budget From the surface water system diagram, appropriate budget components are: Inflows: Rainfall; Surface water from outside boundary, recharge from Groundwater. Outflows: Evapotranspiration; Surface water leaving boundary; Infiltration to groundwater. Storage: Water levels in lakes, rivers, ponds within the boundary; water stored on leaves and other surfaces. Sub-surface Hydrologic System Here is the sub-surface water system broken into its own sub-system. Notice the dashed line is the boundary \u2013 exactly like a control volume in fluids. Sub-surface Water Budget From the sub-surface water system diagram, appropriate budget components are: Inflows: Groundwater flow from outside boundary; Recharge from surface system (via infiltration) Outflows: Groundwater flow out of the boundary; Discharge (pumping; springs) to surface system Storage: Water levels in aquifers within the boundary Combined Hydrologic System Here are the two systems \u201ccombined.\u201d Communication is by the two shaded paths on the figure. Loss from the surface system becomes gain to the ground system. Loss from the ground system becomes gain to the surface system.

Prerequisites: CE 3305 or equivalent COVID-19 Important Guidelines: If Texas Tech University campus operations are required to change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. Should that be necessary, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software. Policy on absences resulting from illness: We anticipate that some students may have extended absences. To avoid students feeling compelled to attend in-person class periods when having symptoms or feeling unwell, a standard policy is provided that holds students harmless for illness-related absences (see Section A below). A. Illness-Based Absence Policy (Face-to-Face Classes) If at any time during the semester you are ill, in the interest of your own health and safety as well as the health and safety of your instructors and classmates, you are encouraged not to attend face-to-face class meetings or events. Please review the steps outlined below that you should follow to ensure your absence for illness will be excused. These steps also apply to not participating in synchronous online class meetings if you feel too ill to do so and missing specified assignment due dates in asynchronous online classes because of illness. If you are ill and think the symptoms might be COVID-19-related: Call Student Health Services at 806.743.2848 or your health care provider. During after-hours and on weekends, contact TTU COVID-19 Helpline at TBD. Self-report as soon as possible using the Dean of Students COVID-19 webpage. This website has specific directions about how to upload documentation from a medical provider and what will happen if your illness renders you unable to participate in classes for more than one week. If your illness is determined to be COVID-19-related, all remaining documentation and communication will be handled through the Office of the Dean of Students, including notification of your instructors of the time you may be absent from and may return to classes. If your illness is determined not to be COVID-19-related, please follow steps 2.a-d below. If you are ill and can attribute your symptoms to something other than COVID-19: If your illness renders you unable to attend face-to-face classes, participate in synchronous online classes, or miss specified assignment due dates in asynchronous online classes, you are encouraged to contact either Student Health Services at 806.743.2848 or your health care provider. Note that Student Health Services and your own and other health care providers may arrange virtual visits. During the health provider visit, request a \u201creturn to school\u201d note. E-mail the instructor a picture of that note. Return to class by the next class period after the date indicated on your note. Following the steps outlined above helps to keep your instructors informed about your absences and ensures your absence or missing an assignment due date because of illness will be marked excused. You will still be responsible to complete within a week of returning to class any assignments, quizzes, or exams you miss because of illness. B. Illness-Based Absence Policy (Telepresence/On-Line Classes) Same as above with respect potential to infect others; go to a health care provider if you are ill. Telepresence courses are recorded and will be available on TTU MediaSite and/or YouTube (unlisted). Exercises, Quizzes, and Examinations are all administered by a Learning Management System (Blackboard) and students need to allow enough time to complete and upload their work. Due date adjustments/late submits on case-by-case basis; documentation required as in subsection A above.

Telepresence (On-line) Courses Obviously electronic devices are vital; disrupting the conference is prohibited, please mute your microphone unless you have a question - consider typing your question into the chat window as well. Be aware of bandwidth issues and remember most lessons and laboratory sessions are recorded and posted on youtube. Recording, editing, and rendering takes awhile, so expect 24-36 hour delay before video is available. ADA Statement: Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to meet the course requirements should contact the instructor as soon as possible to make necessary arrangements. Students must present appropriate verification from Student Disability Services during the instructor's office hours. Please note that instructors are not allowed to provide classroom accommodation to a student until appropriate verification from Student Disability Services has been provided. For additional information, please contact Student Disability Services office in 335 West Hall or call 806.742.2405. Academic Integrity Statement: Academic integrity is taking responsibility for one\u2019s own class and/or course work, being individually accountable, and demonstrating intellectual honesty and ethical behavior. Academic integrity is a personal choice to abide by the standards of intellectual honesty and responsibility. Because education is a shared effort to achieve learning through the exchange of ideas, students, faculty, and staff have the collective responsibility to build mutual trust and respect. Ethical behavior and independent thought are essential for the highest level of academic achievement, which then must be measured. Academic achievement includes scholarship, teaching, and learning, all of which are shared endeavors. Grades are a device used to quantify the successful accumulation of knowledge through learning. Adhering to the standards of academic integrity ensures grades are earned honestly. Academic integrity is the foundation upon which students, faculty, and staff build their educational and professional careers. [Texas Tech University (\u201cUniversity\u201d) Quality Enhancement Plan, Academic Integrity Task Force, 2010]. Religious Holy Day Statement: \u201cReligious holy day\u201d means a holy day observed by a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property taxation under Texas Tax Code \u00a711.20. A student who intends to observe a religious holy day should make that intention known to the instructor prior to the absence. A student who is absent from classes for the observance of a religious holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the absence. A student who is excused may not be penalized for the absence; however, the instructor may respond appropriately if the student fails to complete the assignment satisfactorily. Ethical Conduct Policy: Cheating is prohibited, and the representation of the work of another person as your own will be grounds for receiving a failing grade in the course. DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT, AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE STATEMENT: Texas Tech University is committed to providing and strengthening an educational, working, and living environment where students, faculty, staff, and visitors are free from gender and/or sex discrimination of any kind. Sexual assault, discrimination, harassment, and other Title IX violations are not tolerated by the University. Report any incidents to the Office for Student Rights & Resolution, (806)-742-SAFE (7233) or file a report online at titleix.ttu.edu/students. Faculty and staff members at TTU are committed to connecting you to resources on campus.

CIVILITY IN THE CLASSROOM STATEMENT: Texas Tech University is a community of faculty, students, and staff that enjoys an expectation of cooperation, professionalism, and civility during the conduct of all forms of university business, including the conduct of student\u2013student and student\u2013faculty interactions in and out of the classroom. Further, the classroom is a setting in which an exchange of ideas and creative thinking should be encouraged and where intellectual growth and development are fostered. Students who disrupt this classroom mission by rude, sarcastic, threatening, abusive or obscene language and/or behavior will be subject to appropriate sanctions according to university policy. Likewise, faculty members are expected to maintain the highest standards of professionalism in all interactions with all constituents of the university. To ensure that you are fully engaged in class discussions and account team meetings during class time, you are expected to do the following: - Maintain the same level of civility and professionalism that would be expected in a face-to-face classroom setting. - Attend all classes regularly. - Log into the video conference on time and remain logged in for the duration of the class period. - Activate your camera so that you are visible to the instructor and other students in the class. If you have concerns about leaving your camera on (such as childcare obligations, privacy issues, or a particular circumstance during a class period), please talk to the instructor. - Refrain from engaging in non-class related activities during class time that create a distraction for other students in the class and/or limit your ability to engage in the course. Failure to meet these expectations may result in the following consequences: 1. Being counted as absent for the class meeting. 2. Not receiving credit for class participation for that class period. 3. Other consequences as stipulated in the syllabus, Texas Tech Code of Student Conduct, or other university policy. Repeated failure to meet expectations (e.g., attendance, participation in class, etc.), in addition to the above consequences, may result in the one or more of the following consequences: 1. Referral to the appropriate Associate Dean. 2. Academic penalty, ranging from a warning to failure of the course. (www.depts.ttu.edu/ethics/matadorchallenge/ethicalprinciples.php).

Academic integrity is a personal choice to abide by the standards of intellectual honesty and responsibility. Because education is a shared effort to achieve learning through the exchange of ideas, students, faculty, and staff have the collective responsibility to build mutual trust and respect. Ethical behavior and independent thought are essential for the highest level of academic achievement, which then must be measured. Academic achievement includes scholarship, teaching, and learning, all of which are shared endeavors. Grades are a device used to quantify the successful accumulation of knowledge through learning. Adhering to the standards of academic integrity ensures grades are earned honestly. Academic integrity is the foundation upon which students, faculty, and staff build their educational and professional careers.

A student who is absent from classes for the observance of a religious holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the absence. A student who is excused may not be penalized for the absence; however, the instructor may respond appropriately if the student fails to complete the assignment satisfactorily.","title":"Religious Holy Day Statement:"},{"location":"syllabus/syllabus/#ethical-conduct-policy","text":"Cheating is prohibited, and the representation of the work of another person as your own will be grounds for receiving a failing grade in the course.

CIVILITY IN THE CLASSROOM STATEMENT: Texas Tech University is a community of faculty, students, and staff that enjoys an expectation of cooperation, professionalism, and civility during the conduct of all forms of university business, including the conduct of student\u2013student and student\u2013faculty interactions in and out of the classroom. Further, the classroom is a setting in which an exchange of ideas and creative thinking should be encouraged and where intellectual growth and development are fostered. Students who disrupt this classroom mission by rude, sarcastic, threatening, abusive or obscene language and/or behavior will be subject to appropriate sanctions according to university policy. Likewise, faculty members are expected to maintain the highest standards of professionalism in all interactions with all constituents of the university. To ensure that you are fully engaged in class discussions and account team meetings during class time, you are expected to do the following: - Maintain the same level of civility and professionalism that would be expected in a face-to-face classroom setting. - Attend all classes regularly. - Log into the video conference on time and remain logged in for the duration of the class period. - Activate your camera so that you are visible to the instructor and other students in the class. If you have concerns about leaving your camera on (such as childcare obligations, privacy issues, or a particular circumstance during a class period), please talk to the instructor. - Refrain from engaging in non-class related activities during class time that create a distraction for other students in the class and/or limit your ability to engage in the course. Failure to meet these expectations may result in the following consequences: 1. Being counted as absent for the class meeting. 2. Not receiving credit for class participation for that class period. 3. Other consequences as stipulated in the syllabus, Texas Tech Code of Student Conduct, or other university policy. Repeated failure to meet expectations (e.g., attendance, participation in class, etc.), in addition to the above consequences, may result in the one or more of the following consequences: 1. Referral to the appropriate Associate Dean. 2. Academic penalty, ranging from a warning to failure of the course. (www.depts.ttu.edu/ethics/matadorchallenge/ethicalprinciples.php).
