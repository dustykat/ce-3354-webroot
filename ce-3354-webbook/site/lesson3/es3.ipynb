    "## Semester Project Problem Statement\n",
    "Figure 1 is a map of a portion of Concho County, Texas.  In the Southeast corner of the map is Eden, Texas.  A US highway runs nearly East-West through Eden and another US highway runs North-South.  This watershed is the subject of the semester design project.\n",

    "### Purpose \n",
    "The existing culvert system is a 2-barrel 6X6 box-culvert system.  This report presents an hydrologic analysis of the existing system at an appropriate risk level to determine the depth of water at the structure (or overtopping depth), and a determination of the depth of flow if the culvert system is modified by the addition of two more barrels to a total of 4-barrel 6X6 box-culvert system.\n",

    "## Report Templates:\n",
    "\n",
    "Report templates are supplied below, the PDF is included becuse it can be rendered on the server through a web browser; use your preferred Word Processor tool.\n",

    "## Exercise 1: \n",
    "Using the report template; populate (add words and figures) the following sections:\n",
    " - introduction.  Add some narrative.\n",
    " - watershed.  In ES-2 you delineatedthe watershed that drains to the bridge.  Put a graphic into the report based on your delineation and complete the table.\n",
    " - soil properties.  Use the WSS tool, and determine soil properties for the area (outside of Eden); Put a screen capture into the report based on your delineation .\n",
    " \n",
    "Cite sources used and put citations in the references section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save your work as a PDF file to upload to the class server, and keep a copy for continuing work on the project for the remaindeer of the class."
